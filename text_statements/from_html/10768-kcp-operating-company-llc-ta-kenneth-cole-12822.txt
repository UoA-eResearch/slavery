***** UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 *****
Statement Under the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 For Financial Year 2016
This statement is made pursuant to Section 54, Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act
2015 and sets forth steps KCP Operating Company, LLC (together with its
affiliated companies, “KCP” "we,"or"us") has taken to ensure that slavery and
human trafficking is not taking place in our supply chains or in any part of
our business.  This statement is intended to enable consumers to make more
informed choices about the products they buy and companies they support.
SUMMARY
As discussed below, KCP takes our supply chain responsibilities very
seriously.  We are committed to conducting business in an ethical, lawful, and
responsible manner.  Slavery and human trafficking are complex and horrific
issues and we will not tolerate slavery or human trafficking in our supply
chains or in any part of our business.   
Therefore, our approach begins with identifying suppliers who share our
commitment and who incorporate responsible practices into their own
operations.  We then systematically monitor our suppliers to ensure their
continued compliance and adherence to our standards.  We are equally committed
to investigating, addressing and resolving any concerns that may arise. 
OUR BUSINESS AND SUPPLY CHAINS
For more than 30 years, we have been one of the most recognized fashion
brands.  Beginning with shoes and expanding into fashion accessories and
clothing, our business -- along with the complexity of our supply chains -- has
grown. 
We have two main types of suppliers:  (i) manufacturing facilities that we
directly contract with and monitor; and (ii) licensees who are responsible for
monitoring their own suppliers.  These suppliers are in countries around the
world.  In addition, our licensees source and sell licensed products through
their own distribution channels.  These licensees are also responsible for
monitoring their own suppliers.
OUR ANTI-SLAVERY AND ANTI-HUMAN TRAFFICKING POLICIES
KCP will only do business with companies whose workers are in all cases present
voluntarily, not put at risk of physical harm, fairly compensated, allowed the
right of free association and not exploited in any way.  Our suppliers must
comply with all legal requirements relevant to the conduct of their businesses.
    
Therefore, KCP mandates that all of our suppliers contractually agree to comply
with our Business Partner Terms of Engagement (“Terms of Engagement”).  Those
licensees who source and sell licensed products through their own distribution
channels must also comply with our Terms of Engagement.  The Terms of
Engagement prohibits the use of prison, indentured, bonded or forced labor as
well as prohibits the use of child labor.  The Terms of Engagement also
requires every supplier to certify that its employment practices are in
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including all wage and
benefit laws, child labor laws and regulations, all applicable laws and
regulations governing the safety and health of workers, and all applicable laws
and regulations concerning discrimination in employment.
If KCP determines that a supplier is in violation of our Terms of Engagement,
we may withdraw production or require that the supplier implement a corrective
action plan within a specified time period.  We will work with such problem
suppliers to help them meet our standards.  Except in the clearest and most
severe cases, we prefer not to pull out of a facility at the first sign of
trouble.  Rather, we believe progress can be made by constructive engagement to
better the situation for the supplier and its employees.  However, if a
supplier fails to meet its corrective action plan commitment or repeatedly
violates our Terms of Engagement, we will terminate the business relationship. 
As we apply our standards throughout the world, we will continue to take into
consideration all pertinent information that helps us better address issues of
concern, meet new challenges and improve our guidelines.   
OUR DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES IN RELATION TO SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING   
All new factories manufacturing KCP products must complete a comprehensive Pre-
Sourcing Survey Form which requests specific information pertaining to
compliance with our Terms of Engagement.  No supplier can begin production of
our products until KCP has given written approval authorizing such facility.
  To obtain such approval, the supplier must submit the required information to
the KCP factory compliance staff for review.  A facility may be added to our
approved list of factories only after we have evaluated and approved the new
factory proposal.
All new factories are inspected at the inception of our relationship and KCP
reserves the right to audit the facilities to verify continued compliance with
the Terms of Engagement and all applicable laws and regulations.  Each factory
is inspected every 12 to 18 months by trained auditors for compliance with our
Terms of Engagement.  We work on-site with our suppliers to develop strong
alliances dedicated to responsible business practices and continuous
improvement. 
All inspection reports are reviewed by our Senior Vice-President, Supply Chain
and our Legal Compliance Team.  The Senior Vice-President, Supply Chain and the
Legal Compliance Team hold quarterly meetings to discuss all relevant supply
chain compliance matters, including any factory issues.  
To ensure strict adherence to our standards, we must know who is manufacturing
our products.  Therefore, KCP strictly prohibits unauthorized subcontracting. 
If we discover unauthorized subcontracting, KCP may cancel existing purchase
orders and future purchase orders, as well as remove the contracting supplier
entirely from our list of approved factories.
KCP knows that even regular inspections cannot identify every workplace
problem.  Therefore, we have established an employee hotline that allows our
workers to report concerns to KCP directly and with complete confidentiality -
- calls may be made anonymously if so desired.  KCP makes certain that these
calls are satisfactorily responded to and, if appropriate, investigated and
addressed to ensure proper resolution. 
Our licensees are responsible for monitoring their own supply chains.  We
survey our licensees on a yearly basis and are committed to working with them
to achieve social and environmental welfare throughout our global supply
chains.  The information provided by our licensees in response to the annual
survey includes audits, codes of conduct and factory lists.  
OUR SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
KCP knows the challenge of managing global supply chains in the apparel
industry.  There are well-known reports of slavery and human trafficking in
specific countries and in apparel factories. 
We recognize that certain areas of our supply chains may pose higher risks due
to their geographic locations and our industry.  Therefore, we assess the
countries where potential suppliers operate to determine if the legal and
economic environment creates unreasonable risk to our ability to effectively
implement our standards.  Our Country Assessment Guidelines help us address the
risk of doing business in any particular country.
Regardless of the countries where factories are located, KCP carefully selects
the factories with which we will engage.  As discussed in the Polices and Due
Diligence sections above, we schedule an initial audit by an external, third-
party monitor for all new factories, even those not deemed to be high-risk. 
These third- party auditors inspect the factories, review with the factory any
areas needing improvement and make suggestions as to compliance with KCP
policies and applicable law.  A factory may begin production for us only after
the factory demonstrates compliance with our standards.
In Asia, we contract with a third-party audit firm who is the exclusive
certified consultant for Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP). 
In addition, KCP has recently become a member of Business for Social
Responsibility (BSR) and is working with BSR to develop a set of actions to
further refine our supply chain processes.
EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR ANTI-SLAVERY AND ANTI-HUMAN TRAFFICKING APPROACH 
Years before the UK Modern Slavery Act was enacted, KCP was working to ensure
that slavery and human trafficking was not in our supply chains or in any part
of our business.  In addition to requiring training for our people, we have
been utilizing our own trained professionals as well as retaining third-party
auditors to further our efforts to prevent slavery and human trafficking in our
supply chains and in any part of our business.  During fiscal year 2016, our
audits found instances where suppliers were not in complete compliance with all
of our Terms of Engagement but found no instances of slavery or human
trafficking.  
OUR REQUIRED TRAINING AND CAPACITY BUILDING CONCERNING SLAVERY AND HUMAN
TRAFFICKING AVAILABLE TO OUR STAFF
We require all our employee responsible for our supply chains -- including
those responsible for conducting on-site visits -- to take online training
provided by an American university and taught by leading authorities on
corporate responsibility in supply chains. 
In addition, our third-party auditors undergo training and are sent to
reputable organizations to obtain professional accreditations such as SA 8000
certified auditors, ISO certified auditors, Occupational Health and Safety
Assessment Series (OHSAS), IRCA, and WRAP consultants.
This training helps equip our people to identify and confront slavery and human
trafficking issues.
