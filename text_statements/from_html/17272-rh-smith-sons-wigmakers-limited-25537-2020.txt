****** Modern Slavery Statement ******
****** âQuality Assurance in supply chainâ ******
Founded in 1894, RH Smith & Sons are a family business specialising in the
manufacture and sale of fancy dress, costumes and accessories. Distributing to
over 5000 stockists worldwide, we manufacture using trade partners in the UK,
Far East, Europe and USA. Our head office and creative offices are located in
the UK; Gainsborough & Leeds respectively. We employ over 150 people including
our own staff in the China who oversee production.
With regards to supply chain management, RH Smith & Sons have adopted and
implemented a range of policies and procedures in the selection and management
of manufacturing partners to support quality assurance and ensure compliance
with standards and statutes.
Suppliers must comply with a set of criteria prior to approval and must agree
to the terms of the supplier contract.
*** Modern Slavery and human trafficking ***
In response to the introduction of the Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Act
(2005) R H Smith and Sons have updated supply chain policies and ensured a
comprehensive communications process is in place as follows.
Communication process:
    * The statement on Modern Slavery and Human trafficking is issued along
      with other company policies in the staff handbook to all employees on
      joining the company
    * The supply chain policies, including the statement on Modern Slavery and
      human trafficking can also be found on the company intranet
    * All R H Smith & Sons staff have been presented the Modern Slavery and
      Trafficking statement in a company-wide communicator
    * Training on all supply chain policies including the Modern Slavery and
      human trafficking statement is included in the induction for employees
      with roles relating to supply chain and quality assurance.
    * Additional content relating to the Modern Slavery Act can be sourced on
      the link available to all staff via the intranet:Â Modern_Slavery_Act
      2015
The Far East supply chain has been identified as our highest risk area. The
following reasons were identified in particular:
   1. i) cultural differences and behaviour norms
   2. ii) geographic remoteness
   3. iii) threat of trafficking in high volume shipping location
The following procedures and actions ensure that R H Smith and Sons are
effective in minimising the risk of unacceptable and unethical working terms
and conditions within our business.
    * RH Smith & Sons have employed a team, located in China to monitor
      compliance with the supply chain policies and manage supplier
      relationships including working terms and conditions
    * R H Smith have contracted an AEO registered company to fulfil logistic
      requirements in the Far East territories including responsibility for
      compliance and measures to prevent trafficking, maintaining container
      integrity and assuring a secure supply chain.
    * Modern Slavery Act statement has been issued to suppliers and the
      Supplier Trading Agreement updated to include a section highlighting
      compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
    * Updated ethical policies and codes of practice issued to all staff
      including Hong Kong and China offices and made available on intranet
    * Supply chain management process has been updated to include the
      requirement that any breaches of the Modern Slavery Act identified by any
      member of RH Smith & Sons employees or its suppliers or service providers
      should be reported directly to management or via their respective whistle
      blowing policies.
    * Supply chain monitoring process to be recorded and visible to supply
      chain management team including comments and actions with regular review
      on supplier performance and compliance with all relevant ethical policies
      and codes of practice in conjunction with the team in China.
Note: Wherever Modern Slavery is mentioned in the above, this includes
Trafficking.
