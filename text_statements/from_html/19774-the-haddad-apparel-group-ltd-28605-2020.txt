****** California Transparency in Supply Chains Act ******
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act requires us to disclose our
efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our direct supply
chains. Haddad Brands takes seriously the federal and international efforts to
end all kinds of forced labor - whether in the form of prison labor, indentured
labor, bonded labor, human trafficking or otherwise - through standards set
forth by our licensors, Nike and Leviâs.
    * Supply Chain Verification and Audits:Â Our policy is to evaluate
      potential contracted factories before they enter our supply chain to
      assess compliance with standards including country-related risk for
      issues including forced labor, human trafficking and slavery. We use both
      internal and external, third party audits.
    * Direct Suppliers' Certification of Materials:Â We are working on mapping
      and understanding impacts further up the supply chain, to develop
      standards for upstream suppliers of our contracted manufacturers.
    * Standards for Compliance:Â If a contracted factory is found to violate
      laws or our standards, it is responsible for improving performance
      against a corrective action plan. If the factory fails to make progress
      against that plan, they are subject to review and sanctions, including
      potential termination.
    * Training:Â Employees and management with direct responsibility for supply
      chain management are provided training on forced labor, including human
      trafficking and slavery.
