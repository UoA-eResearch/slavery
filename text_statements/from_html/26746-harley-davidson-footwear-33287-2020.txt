***** California Supply Chain Transparency Act *****
Harley-Davidson Footwear maintains high standards of business ethics and holds
a deep regard for human rights. As corporate citizens, we strive to balance
social and environmental standards with innovative business solutions. We
recognize the importance of responsibly sourced products and are committed to
working with supply chain business partners that are dedicated to safe, humane,
and ethical working conditions that comply with international labor standards.
We require the same from our business partners and have established guidelines
to assist in our efforts to select partners who share our ethical commitments.
Pursuant to the requirements of the California Transparency in Supply Chains
Act, Harley-Davidson Footwear makes the following disclosures of our efforts to
eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our supply chain:
    * Verification
      Harley-Davidson Footwear conducts its own verification and utilizes
      third-party verification for our finish goods factories to assess risks
      related to human trafficking, slavery and other social compliance
      metrics.
    * Auditing
      Harley-Davidson Footwear engages an independent party to conduct
      announced audits of direct suppliers' facilities.
    * Certification
      Harley-Davidson Footwear requires direct suppliers abide by our
      Production_Code_of_Conduct, which requires that our partners commit to
      upholding the human rights of workers, including not utilizing labor from
      victims of human trafficking or slavery, and that they share it with
      their contractors and subcontractors, requiring their adherence as well.
    * Internal Accountability
      Harley-Davidson Footwear maintains internal accountability proceduresÂ 
      to ensure company standards on slavery and human trafficking.
    * Training
      Harley-Davidson Footwear trains its employees who are directly
      responsible for souring finished goods on mitigating the risk of slavery
      and human trafficking in our supply chain.
