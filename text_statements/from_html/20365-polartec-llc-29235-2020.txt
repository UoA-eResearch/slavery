****** California Transparency in Supply Chains Act Disclosure ******
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) (the
âActâ) requires certain manufacturers and retailers doing business in the
State of California to disclose information regarding their efforts to
eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains.
Polartec, LLC (Polartec) adheres to the following procedures:
   1. Verification: In order to verify compliance with the terms set forth in
      the Polartec purchase order, Polartec reserves the right to access a
      supplierâs factories and other sites used for producing, packaging and
      transporting the purchased products and/or services.
   2. Audits: As described in Section 1 above, Polartec reserves the right to
      access a supplierâs site, and may also audit the supplierâs records
      that pertain to purchases made by Polartec.
   3. Certification: Polartec does not currently require certifications from
      its suppliers. However, Polartecâs purchase order terms require the
      supplier to represent and warrant to Polartec that the supplierâs
      production, manufacture, packaging, sale, distribution, installation and
      pricing of any and all products are in full compliance with applicable
      laws, regulations, rules and ordinances in the location where the
      products are made, as well as in jurisdictions through which the products
      pass and are eventually delivered to Polartec or its agents. These
      representations and warranties specifically cite and require compliance
      with labor laws, and expressly prohibit (a) the use of child labor (as
      defined under applicable law); (b) forced or compulsory labor; (c)
      physical abuse of workers; and/or (d) disregard or failure to comply with
      applicable rules and laws governing wages, benefits, working hours,
      working conditions and payment for overtime.
   4. Accountability: Polartec reserves the right to terminate the relationship
      with a supplier if the supplier fails to comply with the terms of the
      purchase order, including for a breach of a representation or warranty
      contained therein.
   5. Training: Polartec provides training to individuals who manage
      procurement and supply chain activities to ensure they understand the
      terms found in the Polartec purchase orders. In addition, all employees
      are provided with a copy of the Polartec internal code of conduct.
