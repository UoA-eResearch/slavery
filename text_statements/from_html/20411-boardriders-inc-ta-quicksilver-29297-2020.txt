                      California Supply Chains Act Notice
 
At Boardriders, Inc., we are committed to conducting business in an ethical
manner and expect our manufacturing partners to share this same commitment.
Accordingly, we established a global ethical program in 2004 titled “QUEST”
(Quiksilver Ethical Standards of Trade), to prevent abusive, exploitive, or
illegal conditions in the workplace and prevent human trafficking and slavery.
QUEST includes a Supplier Workplace Code of Conduct, and all agents, vendors
and factories are required to participate in the QUEST program as a condition
of doing business with our company.
 
Verification: Annually, we evaluate all of our direct manufacturing suppliers
to verify that they are not at risk for violating anti-slavery and human
trafficking laws. Our own internal QUEST team spearheads the verification
process, using an internally developed assessment tool. We also rely on input
from our independent factory auditors to assess these risks and
vulnerabilities.  
 
Supplier Audits: We monitor supplier behavior and compliance with QUEST through
our independent contractor with unannounced audits and ongoing monitoring.
 
Certification: To ensure that our suppliers respect and enforce our QUEST
standards, the commercial agreements governing our contractual relationship
often stipulate that our suppliers must abide by our QUEST standards, or the
contractual relationship is subject to termination. More specifically, we ask
our suppliers to agree to provide workers with a safe and healthy work
environment; allow workers freedom of association and collective bargaining;
conduct business in compliance with applicable environmental, labor, and
employment laws; refrain from corrupt practices; and protect against human
trafficking and slavery. We also require our suppliers to certify that
materials incorporated into our products comply with applicable laws, including
those laws that relate to slavery and human trafficking in the country or
countries in which they do business.
 
Internal Accountability: Non-compliance with our QUEST standards can result in
a Corrective Action Plan, under which our employees and contractors are
expected to follow a series of steps to correct their noncompliance  in order
for them to remain an active employee or contractor. Otherwise, they face
termination. Throughout the assessment process, factory management is educated
and assisted on any noncompliance issue encountered during the applicable
audit.
 
Training: As part of our efforts to ensure compliance with our QUEST standards
and prevent abusive, exploitive, or illegal conditions in the workplace, our
QUEST department conducts ongoing internal employee and management training
regarding our code and human rights concerns, including human trafficking and
slavery associated with our supply chains. The training specifically covers
mitigating risks of human trafficking and slavery within our company’s supply
chains of products, and is mandatory for those company employees and management
who have direct responsibility for supply chain management.
