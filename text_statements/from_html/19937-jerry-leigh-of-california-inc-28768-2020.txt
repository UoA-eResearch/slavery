***** Code of conduct *****
We expect these same commitments to be shared by all manufacturers of Jerry
Leigh merchandise.Â At a minimum, we require that all manufacturers of Jerry
Leigh merchandise meet the following standards:
Child LaborÂ Manufacturers will not use child labor under any circumstance.
The term âchildâ refers to a person younger than 16 (or 15 where local law
allows) or, if higher, the local legal minimum age for employment or the age
for completing compulsory education.
Manufacturers employing younger persons who do not fall within the definition
of âChildrenâ will also comply with any laws and regulations applicable to
such persons.
Involuntary LaborÂ Manufacturers will not use any forced or involuntary labor,
whether prison, bonded, indentured or otherwise.
Coercion and HarassmentÂ Manufacturers will treat each employee with dignity
and respect, and will not use corporal punishment, threats of violence or other
forms of physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse.
NondiscriminationÂ Manufacturers will not discriminate in hiring and employment
practices, including salary, benefits, advancement, discipline, termination or
retirement, on the basis of race, religion, age, nationality, social or ethnic
origin, sexual orientation, gender, political opinion, pregnancy status, or
disability.
AssociationÂ Manufacturers will respect the rights of employees to associate,
organize and bargain collectively in a lawful and peaceful manner, without
penalty or interference.
Health and SafetyÂ Manufacturers will provide employees with a safe and healthy
workplace, in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, ensuring at
a minimum:
(a) Access to potable water and sanitary facilities; (b) Fire safety;
(c) Adequate lighting and ventilation; and
(d) Proper safety equipment.
Manufacturers will also ensure that the same standards of health and safety are
applied in any housing that they provide for employees.
CompensationÂ Manufacturers will, at a minimum, comply with all applicable wage
and hour laws and regulations, including those relating to minimum wages,
overtime, maximum hours, piece rates and other elements of compensation, and
provide legally mandated benefits. We expect manufacturers to recognize that
wages are essential to meeting employeeâs basic needs.
Except in extraordinary business circumstances, manufacturers will not require
employees to work more than the lesser of:
(a) 48 hours per week and 12 hours overtime or
(b) the limits on regular and overtime hours allowed by local law or, where
local law does not limit the hours of work, the regular work week plus 12 hours
overtime. In addition, employees will be entitled to at least one day off in
every seven-day period.
Manufacturers will compensate employees for overtime hours at such premium rate
as is legally required or, if there is no legally prescribed premium rate, at a
rate at least equal to the regular hourly compensation rate.
Where local industry standards are higher than applicable legal requirements,
we expect manufacturers to meet the higher standards.
Record KeepingÂ Manufacturers must use an automated time-clock system to
document workers hours. Inaccurate and inconsistent record keeping constitutes
falsification of records which will not be tolerated.
InsuranceÂ Manufacturers will provide social insurance for all workers as
mandated by local laws.
EnvironmentÂ Manufacturers will comply with all applicable environmental laws
and regulations.
Other LawsÂ Manufacturers will comply with all applicable laws and regulations,
including those pertaining to the manufacture, pricing, sales and distribution
of merchandise. All references to âapplicable laws and regulationsâ in this
Code of Conduct include local and national codes, rules and regulations as well
as applicable treaties and voluntary industry standards.
Subcontracting Manufacturers will not use subcontractors for the manufacture of
Jerry Leigh of California merchandise or a component thereof, without Jerry
Leigh of Californiaâs express written consent. All subcontractors must be
approved by the designated licensor and/ or retailer for whom the cut is
produced before production begins.
Monitoring and ComplianceÂ Manufacturers will authorize Jerry Leigh of
California and its designated agents (including third parties) to engage in
monitoring activities to confirm compliance with this Code of Conduct,
including unannounced on-site inspections of manufacturing facilities and
employer-provided housing; reviews of books and records relating to employment
matters; and private interviews with employees. Manufacturers will maintain on
site all documentation that may be needed to demonstrate compliance with this
Code of Conduct. Manufacturers must submit a written Corrective Action Plan
within 2 weeks of receipt of audit report, with proof of remediation of any and
all violations.
PublicationÂ Manufacturers will take appropriate steps to ensure that the
provisions of this Code of Conduct are communicated to its employees, including
the prominent posting of a copy of this Code of Conduct, in the local language
and in a place readily accessible to employees, at all times.
***** Social & Environment Responsibilities *****
Throughout our 50+ year history as a family owned company, Jerry Leigh Apparel
has demonstrated a legacy of caring for our employees, our community, and our
stakeholders near and far. As awareness of environmental issues has increased,
Jerry Leigh has begun to incorporate sustainability efforts into our long-
standing, stringent social compliance practices and policies. We have also
extended this same commitment to our many retail and licensor/licensee
partners.
Jerry Leigh views the ongoing process of becoming more sustainable very
seriously. From the top down JL is committed to reducing waste and water usage
and innovating operations within our office and supply chain. In 2009, Jerry
Leigh completed a large scale installation of solar panels on our corporate
headquartersâ roof, just one step on the larger path of our commitment to
reduce resource use.
All of Jerry Leigh product manufacturers, domestic and international, adhere to
a strict compliance contract. We are diligent in choosing and continuously
educating our partners on our retailersâ and licensorsâ requirements. We
work with the very best representatives of the global community to ensure all
products are manufactured in socially compliant factories.
Our commitment to incorporate sustainability practices into our daily
operations, manufacturing, and supplier, retailer, licensor/licensee and
employee engagements is a reflection of the high quality of our products and
our respect for a shared global environment.
***** Transparency in Supply Chain Act *****
On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010
(SB 657) went into effect in the State of California. This law was designed to
increase the amount of information made available by manufacturers regarding
their efforts (if any) to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking,
thereby allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the
products they buy and the companies they choose to support.
Jerry Leigh has offices in Shanghai, China and in Guatemala City (in addition
to U.S. offices), enabling Jerry Leigh to regularly visit and audit contractors
in those countries, which represent the vast majority of our production.
In order to combat slavery and human trafficking, forced and child labor, Jerry
Leigh is committed to the following policies:
   1. Verification âÂ Jerry Leigh performs assessments of potential supplier
      factories according to a risk-based approach. This approach includes
      preliminary risk assessments through contractor questionnaires in
      addition to factory compliance assessments performed by Jerry Leigh
      personnel. This includes required submission of recent third party audit
      reports. Additionally, Jerry Leigh has developed, and issues, a Jerry
      Leigh Manufacturer Code of Conduct to all contractors. Â Contractors are
      evaluated in relation to their compliance with the Manufacturer Code of
      Conduct though periodic third party audits.
   2. Audits âÂ Jerry Leigh is a proud licensee of the Walt Disney Company,
      Hasbro, Marvel, Williamson Dickie, and other licensed brands. We supply
      product to Walmart, Sears Holdings, Kohlâs, and many other retailers.
      As such, Jerry Leigh is required to, and agrees to perform regular social
      compliance audits of all facilities. With few exceptions, the audits are
      unannounced; and, all are performed by third-party audit firms.
   3. Certification âÂ Jerry Leighâs purchasing agreements require all
      suppliers to comply with all applicable laws within the country of
      business, with international standards, with trade regulations, and with
      the Manufacturer Code of Conduct regarding slavery and human trafficking.
   4. Accountability âÂ Jerry Leigh employs the use of corrective action
      plans which outline how a supplier will resolve issues uncovered in
      audits. Jerry Leigh has a zero-tolerance policy for the presence of
      slavery and human trafficking. If any zero-tolerance items are uncovered
      in audits, we require suppliers to rectify the problem immediately, and
      provide documentation and proof of remediation. The facility is then
      reaudited to confirm resolution of the issue. If the contractor fails to
      correct a zero tolerance violation in a timely manner, including slavery
      and human trafficking, Jerry Leigh may terminate the business
      relationship.
   5. Direct accountability and training of procurement professionals
      âÂ Jerry Leigh maintains and enforces internal accountability
      procedures for employees regarding company standards in slavery and human
      trafficking. Â Â Jerry Leigh conducts regular internal training for all
      procurement and sourcing personnel and management to ensure that they are
      knowledgeable and aware of the issues and concerns surrounding the supply
      chain, including human trafficking and slavery, with a particular focus
      on mitigating risks. Training is also conducted by some of our retailers
      and contractors are strongly encouraged to participate, wherever
      possible. All facilities are audited by 3rd party auditors, irrespective
      of whether or not they participate in training.
