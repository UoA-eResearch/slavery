****** Modern Slavery Act Statement ******
Alfred Dunhill Limited
The Modern Slavery Act 2015 Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement

This statement is made pursuant to Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015
(\"Act\") and sets out the steps Alfred Dunhill Limited has taken to ensure
that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place within its supply chains
nor within any part of our business. This statement is for the financial year
ended 31 March 2016. Alfred Dunhill Limited has a zero tolerance approach to
modern slavery and we are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in
all our business dealings.

Our Business
Alfred Dunhill Limited engages with carefully selected suppliers to manufacture
its products and/or provide relevant services to the company. We sell our
products either through Alfred Dunhill Limitedâs own managed points of sales,
through authorised wholesale accounts or through the subsidiaries of the
Richemont Group (âGroupâ). As part of the Group, Alfred Dunhill Limited
adheres to Group policies, procedures and standards relating to the management
of its supply chain and the conduct of its business generally. Details of the
Groupâs business governance and corporate social responsibility policies can
be found at https://www.richemont.com/corporate-social-responsibility/
governance-ethics/policies.html.

Our Supply Chain Relationships
Alfred Dunhill Limited has an extensive range of global supplier relationships.
Alfred Dunhill Limited strives to maintain good and lengthy relationships with
suppliers based on the principle of fair, open, honest and ethical dealings at
all times.

Our Policies and Processes
During our procurement process, Alfred Dunhill Limited issues purchase orders
which incorporate our terms and conditions of purchase (âTermsâ). The Terms
are further supplemented by the Richemont Supplier Code of Conduct (\"Code of
Conduct\") and other policies issued by our Group.
The Code of Conduct includes an endorsement of International Labour
Organisation Conventions, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other
internationally recognised labour practice standards. A copy of the Code of
Conduct is available at: https://www.richemont.com/images/csr/2015/
supplier_code_of_conduct_2015.pdf. We are seeking to ensure that all high risk
Alfred Dunhill Limited suppliers sign the Code of Conduct and adhere to the
requirements set out therein. For those suppliers whom are of lower risk,
Alfred Dunhill Limited will be formally reminding them of their obligations
under the Act and requesting written undertakings from them of their commitment
to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their own business and supply
chain.
Alfred Dunhill Limited undertakes due diligence when considering taking on new
suppliers. Such due diligence is carried out by the supply chain and
procurement teams within the business.
In addition, Alfred Dunhill Limited works in partnership with a company who is
an AAG member of SEDEX and utilises auditors with Social Accountability
Certification SA8000 accreditation in order to carry out audits of Alfred
Dunhill Limited's suppliers. In the event that Alfred Dunhill Limitedâs due
diligence or audits highlight a risk of slavery and human trafficking or any
other non-compliance with the Code of Conduct, we will assess such non-
compliance on a case by case basis and take appropriate remedial action.
We endeavour to trade with those suppliers who comply with the Code of Conduct
or those who are taking verifiable steps towards compliance. Arrangements with
suppliers in material or persistent breach will be terminated.

Our Training
The Group and Alfred Dunhill Limited are undertaking steps to increase employee
awareness and compliance regarding slavery and human trafficking issues. 
Richemontâs Corporate Social Responsibility Guidelines (âGuidelinesâ),
which articulate the standards the Group expects its managers, employees and
suppliers to uphold, specifically articulate the Groupâs zero-tolerance
policy regarding forced labour. A copy of the Guidelines can be found at: 
https://www.richemont.com/images/csr/2012/
extract_corporate_social_responsbilitiy_guidelines_based_on_jul08_version.pdf

Our Employees
Alfred Dunhill Limited and the Group have a whistleblowing policy and a hotline
for employees to voice any concerns they may have including concerns about
slavery and human trafficking within Alfred Dunhill Limitedâs supply chain or
any part of the Alfred Dunhill Limited business. Alfred Dunhill Limited is
committed to maintaining and improving systems and processes in order to
eliminate all forms of forced and compulsory labour within its supply chain and
its business.
Alfred Dunhill Limited will continue to review its policies and processes to
ensure the highest standards in its supply chain, as expected by customers, the
companies with which it works and in accordance with the requirements of its
Group.
