****** Modern Slavery Policy ******
This statement has been published in accordance with the UK Modern Slavery Act
2015

It outlines the measures taken by Yours Clothing Ltd and other relevant group
companies during the 2018/19 financial year to assess and prevent the risk of
slavery and human trafficking occurring in its business or supply.
**** About Yours â How our business operates and is structured ****
Yours Clothing Limited is a privately owned United Kingdom limited liability
company. Yours have been a Plus sized clothing retailer since 1993. Yours
designs, develops, sources and sells clothing and accessories both in the UK
and globally, operating in multi countries. Yours products are sold through our
own retail and outlet stores as well as through stores operated by our
franchise partners and online via our digital platforms. At 1st August 2018,
Yours employed over 1,200 people including part time employees in its 150
stores, 1 distribution depot and head office based in Peterborough UK.
Corporate functions providing services in Human Resources, Finance, IT,
Marketing and Retail operations are located at the Peterborough Yours head
office.

**** Our Supply Chains ****
While we undertake most of the design and development of our products
ourselves, we outsource the manufacturing of all our products. In most
factories, the facilities are shared with production for other Clothing &
Accessories brands. We work closely and collaboratively with suppliers and
service providers, numbering +100 suppliers in over 10 countries.

**** Addressing the risks of Modern Slavery and Human trafficking ****
Yours attaches real importance to the welfare of our employees and those
employed by our suppliers. We are taking steps to strengthen our understanding
and management of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our own
business or our supply chains, building on our Terms & Conditions and Code of
Practice for Suppliers. These steps include:

    * Mapping our supplier chains to assess particular industry/sector and
      geographical risk, to have a clear idea of where the business risks lie
    * Assessment scope covers all aspects of our business including Retail
      operations, Property, Logistics, HR and IT as well as our product supply
      chains
    * Meeting with a 3rd party to discuss conducting a modern slavery risk
      assessment on behalf of Yours Clothing
    * Reviewing our governance structures for responsible sourcing of Goods for
      Resale (GfR) and Goods Not for Resale (GNfR)
    * Published the Yours Modern Slavery statement
During the remainder of the 2018/19 financial year, Yours will continue to
build on these activities, considering the following areas in particular:

    * Internally publish the findings of modern slavery risk assessment,
      collate action plan to further mitigate risks and drive improvement using
      best practice examples from other retailers
    * Engage our supply base by writing to all areas of our business to raise
      awareness of the Modern Slavery Act and Human Rights
    * Review of potential KPIs and monitoring

**** Our policies relating to Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking ****
Yours Terms & Conditions and Code of Practice for Suppliers are available via
the Bureau Veritas Yours website and published on our web site
www.yoursclothing.co.uk

Terms & Conditions
Our T&Câs outlines the values and principles that help shape the way we work.
It is primarily aimed at employees and we encourage our business partners,
including suppliers, franchise and partners, to adopt and apply the T&Câs
wherever they represent or promote the Yours brand. The key principles include:
    * We treat all employees and each other fairly, with dignity and respect
    * We operate with integrity and honesty
    * We base our business relationships on respect; and expect the same from
      those that we do business with

Code of Practice for Suppliers
Yours Code of Practice summarises the minimum standards for working conditions
that we expect our Suppliers to adhere to in the production of all Yours
products. The Code of Practice requires compliance with all local legal and
regulatory requirements of the country in which the facility is located; to
recognise International standards and to uphold the core labour conventions of
the International Labour Organization. Where there is any conflict between
these we expect the higher standard to be achieved.

It contains specific requirements related to forced labour as follows:

    * All work must be conducted on a voluntary basis, and not under threat of
      any penalty or sanctions.
    * The Supplier shall not use any form of forced, bonded, indentured,
      trafficked, slave or prison labour.
    * Workers must not be required to lodge "deposits" or their identity papers
      with their employer. All workers should be provided free and unrestricted
      access to potable water and clean toilet facilities.
    * As used in the Code of Practice the term âSupplierâ includes but is
      not limited to vendors, agents, factories, sub-contractors and material &
      component suppliers

HR policies
Yours Clothing Ltd will not use or allow the use of forced, compulsory labour,
slavery, servitude or human trafficking in the course of its business. This
includes sexual exploitation, securing services by force, threats or deception
and securing services from children and vulnerable persons.
Our employment procedures guarantee that Yours Clothing Ltd conducts
appropriate checks on all staff to ensure they can legally work in the United
Kingdom.
In addition, all internal policies are reviewed regularly to ensure continued
compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

Yours operates the following policies which are relevant to the prevention of
slavery and human trafficking in its operations:

    * Outsourcing Policy. This establishes that Yours Clothing Ltd will
      continue to comply with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and conduct annual
      reviews of outsourced suppliers
    * Recruitment Policy. This confirms that Yours Clothing Ltd will conduct
      checks on all staff to safeguard that they can legally work in the United
      Kingdom

Corporate Responsibility Policy
This policy is designed to ensure that Yours Clothing Ltd is conducting its
business responsibly.

    * Whistleblowing Policy. Yours Clothing Ltd encourages all of its employees
      to report any concerns related to the activities of the firm. The
      organisationâs whistleblowing procedure is designed to ensure that any
      matter raised under this procedure will be investigated thoroughly,
      promptly and confidentially, and the outcome of the investigation
      reported back to the individual who raised the issue. Additionally, the
      policy guarantees that no one will be victimised for raising a matter
      under this procedure.

Due Diligence and Audits of suppliers
We believe that our biggest exposure to Modern Slavery is in our product supply
chains, which is a biggest focus initially. Within these areas, new suppliers
and factories/sites are subject to due diligence checks in the form of a valid
3rd party ethical audit to SMETA (or similar standards). Existing factories are
also required to provide Yours with 3rd party audit information.
In common with other retailers, audits are conducted either by our Yours Buying
& Garment Technical team or by a third-party service provider on our behalf.
These audits are used to assess compliance with Yours Terms & Conditions and
Code of practice for suppliers and identify issues for investigation so action
can be taken.
In the first instance, we aim to gather the information through our audit
programme to take action to improve conditions were necessary and to inform
sourcing decisions.
Yours does not tolerate forced labour, slavery or human trafficking within our
direct operations or supply chains. Where any non-compliance to Yours Code of
Practice for Suppliers is identified, we expect and support suppliers to take
action to correct it. If a supplier does not take effective action in a timely
manner withdrawing our business remains the final sanction.

**** Training & Awareness ****
We aim to hold awareness training, on the prevalence of modern slavery and the
Modern Slavery Act to highlight the issue and how we expect all employees to
play their part.

**** Reviewing progress ****
Supply chains can change for many reasons and the threat of modern slavery can
continue to evolve and change. We intend to continue to monitor and review our
controls that guard against the risk of modern slavery which will be shared and
reported on.
