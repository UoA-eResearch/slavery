****** California Transparency in Supply Chain Act ******
Last updated  6 Aug 2019
***** California Transparency in Supply Chain Act *****
Introduction________
The Hermès Group supports the goals of the California Transparency in Supply
Chains Act of 2010 (“Act”) and strives to be a model example of human rights
and fair labor practices throughout its business activities.
The Hermès Group chooses the best suppliers in its field – those who lead not
only in terms of the quality of their products and services but also by way of
their social and environmental approaches. To this end, the Hermès Group
chooses its suppliers based upon both their ethics and integrity in their
business dealings, as well as the social and environmental principles by which
they operate.
The implementation of the Act presents the opportunity for the Hermès Group to
reaffirm its commitment to enforcing measures that fight against slavery and
human trafficking. 
As a responsible corporate actor, the Hermès Group has long since integrated
standards of the Act into its daily business. 
The Hermès Group’s actions in this area include the following:
Verification_of_Requirements_for_Suppliers________
The Hermès Group has implemented the Hermès Group Code of Good Conduct (“Code”)
for its suppliers. The Code sets forth and establishes non-negotiable minimum
standards for the Hermès Group’s suppliers in the areas of health and safety,
labor standards, business integrity and the environment. In addition, the
Hermès Group may conduct third-party supplier audits, described below, in order
to verify that its suppliers are complying with these minimum standards.
More information can be found at: www.sa-intl.org and www.pactemondial.org ,
which set forth the standards which the Hermès Group has incorporated into its
Code.
Supplier_Audits________
The Hermès Group audits suppliers that, based upon an analysis of the volume of
the supplier’s business and the risk of abuses in the country in which the
supplier is located, pose a high risk of working condition violations. The
Hermès Group announces the audit and then delegates the audit to a third party,
in charge of ensuring that its suppliers are compliant with Social
Accountability International’s SA8000 standards, an international standardized
code of conduct for improving working conditions around the world, and are
compliant with the Code.
Certification_of_Supplier_Compliance________
The Hermès Group requires its suppliers to sign and to adhere to the Code.
Maintaining_Accountability________
In the event the Hermès Group becomes aware of any actions or conditions not in
compliance with its Code, the Hermès Group reserves the right to demand
corrective measures.
The Hermès Group reserves the right to terminate an agreement with any supplier
who does not comply with the Code. 
Training_to_Company_Employees________
The Hermès Group employees worldwide have access to a special website which
fully explains the commitments of the Hermès Group, including anti-slavery and
human trafficking measures.
Further, the Hermès Group’s ethical charter clearly states that it is the
company’s policy to uphold human rights in its supply chains. This charter has
been translated into nine different languages and is communicated throughout
the Hermès Group.
The Hermès Group also performs audits of its suppliers to ensure that these
fair labor principles are effectively applied.
The Hermès Group and its employees endeavor to respect the laws and regulation
in all countries in which they operate, and conducts its business according to
universal principles laid down by international agreements and standards. In
particular, the Hermès Group adheres to the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which
draws from a variety of legislative instruments, such as national and EU laws,
international conventions from the Council of Europe, United Nations (UN) and
International Labour Organisation (ILO) directives, and the United Nations
Global Compact, a strategic policy initiative for businesses that are committed
to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted
principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anti-
corruption.
The Hermès Group will continue to evolve and adapt its policies and procedures
to a changing world in order to reflect the company’s unwavering commitment to
ethical business principles.
