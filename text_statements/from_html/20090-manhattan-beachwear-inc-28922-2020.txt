CA Transparency in Supply Chain Act
The state of California has recently challenged companies doing business in
California to join its effort to identify and eliminate slavery and human
trafficking in supply chains. In line with this effort, we as a company are
posting our Global Sourcing and Operational Guidelines to state publicly the
following ways we ensure that no slavery or egregious labor practices exist
within our product supply chains. Manhattan Beachwear has used these guidelines
to make responsible sourcing decisions and they are the cornerstone of our
business relationship with contractors worldwide.
1)      We require our suppliers to provide details regarding their supply
chains that may indicate a risk of slavery or egregious practices. We utilize
independent 3rd party investigators to assess the risks and business and audit
their compliance to our sourcing guidelines.
2)      Although, based on current information, our supply chain is unlikely to
incorporate slavery or egregious labor practices, if serious risks are
identified, we will immediately request our third party investigators to
conduct an audit.
3)      As we place new orders, we will be requiring our suppliers to provide
certification that the materials incorporated into the product comply with all
applicable laws regarding slavery or egregious labor practices in the country
or countries in which those supplies are doing business.
4)      Our company policies require our personnel to operate in accordance
with applicable laws and to report any violations of laws by our supplies and
others of which they become aware. Accordingly, we have internal accountability
standards and procedures in place in the event of any instances of egregious
labor practices.
5)      Company employees and management who have direct responsibility for
supply chain management will be trained with regard to maintaining risks of
slavery or egregious labor practices.
Manhattan Beachwear, Inc. commitment to responsible business practices guides
our decisions and behavior as a company everywhere we do business.
It is our goal that our efforts and those of other manufacturers and retailers
will have the intended effect of minimizing the human trafficking, slavery or
egregious labor practices in our supply chains.
