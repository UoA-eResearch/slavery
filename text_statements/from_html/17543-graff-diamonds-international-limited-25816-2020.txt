Anti-slavery statement
****** Modern Slavery And Human
TraffickingÂ Statement ******
Graff is a vertically integrated diamond jewellery business. Our operations
comprise the design, manufacture and retail distribution of high and ultra-high
end jewellery and watches. In addition, through our procurement and polishing
division we source, cut and polish rough diamonds primarily for use in our
retail operations.
Whilst the diamond industry has in the past been associated with conflict and
exploitation, the industry has taken a number of pro-active steps to combat
this, most notably in the form of the Kimberley Process (which certifies that
diamonds originate from conflict free zones). Graff has always been at the
forefront of such developments and is committed to acting in an ethical and
responsible manner in all its business practices. We do not tolerate slavery,
servitude, forced or compulsory labour or human trafficking either within our
business or within our supply chains. We expect all members of our supply chain
to share the same values and adhere to the same best practice guidelines to
ensure that no such forced labour exists within their business or their own
supply chains.
Through our procurement and polishing division we are subject to the rigorous
requirements of the De Beers Best Practice Principles (BPPs). These BPPs set
out the detailed standards our procurement and polishing division, Safdico, is
required to adhere to in order to maintain its âSightholderâ status with De
Beers. Among other requirements the BPPs focus carefully on supply chain
management, provenance claims, child and forced labour and ethical standards
generally. Alongside Safdico we are regularly subject to audit procedures in
order to ensure ongoing compliance with the BPPs. This has, over a number of
years, fostered a culture of increased vigilance and compliance within Graff.
Nonetheless, we are conscious that with an extensive supply chain with wide
geographical reach, more can always be done.Â  And whilst we would never
knowingly engage with a supplier involved in forced labour, we recognise that
such a supplier would take steps to conceal the true position, meaning that
continued vigilance is always necessary.
We have therefore developed a Code of Conduct which has been distributed to all
new and existing suppliers of the Graff group of companies. This Code of
Conduct rejects the use of forced labour. We expect our suppliers to comply
with the Code of Conduct and to place similar expectations on their supply
chains.
The Code of Conduct sets out our right to audit compliance by inspecting
facilities and interviewing staff members (a practice we already undertake on a
regular basis as part of our existing procurement and due diligence processes
when engaging a new supplier) as well as our right to review records, policies
and practices. This will facilitate our ongoing due diligence processes and
allow us to identify issues of concern. All these processes have been further
developed and enhanced during the financial year ended 31 December 2018, to
which this statement relates.
If we identify or suspect non-compliance with the Code of Conduct we will work
with the relevant supplier to ensure that immediate remedial action is taken to
address the situation, failing which to stop working with the supplier in
question.
Our commitment across all the Graff group of companies is to ensuring that
there is no forced labour within our supply chains is an ongoing process. Our
future plans include further training for staff and development of our due
diligence procedures, both when we engage a new supplier and on an ongoing
basis in respect of our existing suppliers.
This statement has been approved by the board of Graffâs parent company and
relates to the financial year ended 31 December 2018. It applies to all the
entities within the Graff group of companies.
