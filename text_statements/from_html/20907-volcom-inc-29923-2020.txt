 harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or
services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of
subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery" as
outlined in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000. As a
company, we strongly condemn these practices and do not allow them to have a
place in our supply chains. The following describes how we oversee our supply
chains for continued compliance: VERIFICATION We assess the risks of slavery
and human trafficking by understanding that such practices can happen anywhere.
With that in mind, we regularly review our supply chain and audit all certified
factories that we do substantial business with to ensure that they show
continued compliance with the Volcom Code of Conduct and all applicable laws,
rules and regulations. Our Code of Conduct covers issues such as maximum
working hours, fair wages, respect, equality, and restriction of forced labor
(amongst others). AUDITING Our verification practices include third-party
audits of the entire factory, including its dormitories. We work with Bureau
Veritas for all our audits. The auditing teams interview groups of workers, as
well as individuals, without the presence of their management, to allow them to
comment on their working conditions and any suspected abuse. We require every
new factory in our supply chain to present a recent, passing report from a
third-party auditing firm or other approved auditing body to comply with the
requirements for our new vendor/factory set-up. Our audits are semi-unannounced
in advance with a two-week window to give the factory time to prepare for the
visit and compile all the necessary documentation. If an audit report ever
brings up evidence regarding any violations of the Code above, we work with the
factory to create a Corrective Action Plan clearly listing solutions with
estimated completion dates for each non- compliant point. If a re-audit is
necessary, it is un-announced, and the factory is given a two-week window. If
we ever discover suspected child labor, slave labor, or forced labor, we take
immediate action to correct the issue and send auditors in seven (7) days later
to confirm that the factory is compliant. Volcom schedules audits based on a
factory's past audit result and risk level. This can be scheduled every 7, 12,
18 or 24 months per Volcomâs discretion. For a factory with a Volcom accepted
certificate/brand audit, we are willing to accept their certificates in lieu of
a Volcom audit if we can review the full report and track the completion of
their Corrective Action Plan. These actions help to verify that there is no
human trafficking or slave labor in our supply chain. CERTIFICATION AND CODE OF
CONDUCT Every year Volcom updates its vendor manual with the current
requirements, and we require our entire supplier base to sign agreements noting
that they have read, understood, and implemented the requirements set forth.
One of these agreements is our Work Place Code of Conduct. The Volcom Work
Place Code of Conduct covers the following aspects (a copy of the Code can be
found here): Compliance with the Law Employment Standards Child Labor/Young
Labor/Forced Labor Health and Safety Freedom of Association, Discrimination,
and Disciplinary Practices Working Hours and Compensation Environment C-TPAT
(Customs Trade Pact Against Terrorism) Additionally, our Vendor/Manufacturing
Agreement specifically requires the vendor/manufacturer to warrant and
represent that "it is not engaged in, and will not engage in any activities
which are in violation of any applicable domestic, foreign or international
laws, rules, or regulations, including without limitation, laws, rules or
regulations governing labor." Vendors agree to comply with the Code and to
disclose the names and addresses of every factory, contractor, and sub-
contractor that they use to produce raw materials and/or garments for Volcom.
All of these factories, contractors, and sub-contractors must also comply with
the Code, otherwise our vendors are not allowed to do business with them.
Lastly, the vendors agree to allow Volcom staff and representatives to inspect
the facilities to ensure compliance by visiting or conducting audits. Volcom
reserves the right to discontinue business with vendors who do not comply with
the Code or who work with factories, contractors, and sub-contractors that do
not comply. INTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY Volcom requires all new hires to sign and
agree to comply with our Code of Business Conduct & Ethics and Reporting Fraud.
This Code specifically states "Volcom employees must comply with all applicable
labor and employment laws, including anti-discrimination laws and laws related
to freedom of association, privacy and collective bargaining." If there is ever
a violation of the Code, employees have a duty to report the violation to their
supervisor or department head, or a member of the senior management. All
reports are handled anonymously. The Code further explains how violations are
handled: It is Volcomâs policy that any employee who violates this Code will
be subject to appropriate discipline, including possible termination of
employment. This determination will be based upon the facts and circumstances
of each particular situation. An employee who is thought to have possibly
violated this Code will be given an opportunity to present his or her version
of the events at issue prior to any determination of appropriate discipline.
Volcom is in the process of educating our contractors and business partners on
the hazards of human trafficking and slavery, and encouraging them to
investigate their supply chains to eradicate this problem within their own
organizations. TRAINING Our Compliance Department continuously engages in
online tutorials and webinars to continue their training and deepen their
knowledge regarding slavery and human trafficking laws. In addition to this
online training, members of the design, merchandising, production, compliance,
and legal teams came together December 2, 2011 for a Corporate Social
Responsibility seminar hosted by Intertek, which focused on identifying and
mitigating risks in the supply chain, particularly regarding factoriesâ
employment practices. Volcom plans to continue this training by conducting one-
on-one meetings for new hires or for employees with new responsibilities in the
relevant area, as well as major group trainings whenever there are new
developments within slavery and human trafficking enforcement. Our auditing
partners provide compliance seminars in China that our vendors can attend.
Vendors are always welcome to contact Volcomâs Compliance Department at any
time with regards to any compliance questions or concerns, and the Department
will work with them to resolve any issues they may have. CONSUMER EDUCATION
Volcom has always been supportive of its most avid fans. We hope that our
customers are as dedicated to eradicating slavery and human trafficking as we
are. We would appreciate the opportunity to answer any questions regarding our
supply chain transparency and compliance procedures. Volcom is pleased to
present this information for compliance with The California Transparency in
Supply Chains Act, which we feel is a good tool to enable companies to explain
their personal efforts to eradicate the practice of slave labor and human
trafficking. Hopefully, with our fellow brandsâ help, our combined statements
will make a large impact on these dark areas of the industry and help move us
towards a fairer manufacturing future. COMPLIANCE Volcom Certificates of

****** CALIFORNIA SB657 DISCLOSURE ******
* THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT DISCLOSURE *
In September 2010, the government of California approved a new_law, which
requires retailers and manufacturers operating in the state to make public the
steps they have undertaken to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from
their supply and distribution chain. Volcom considers the practice of slave
labor and human trafficking to involve "the recruitment, harboring,
transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services,
through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to
involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery" as outlined in the
Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000. As a company, we strongly
condemn these practices and do not allow them to have a place in our supply
chains.
The following describes how we oversee our supply chains for continued
compliance:
* VERIFICATION *
We assess the risks of slavery and human trafficking by understanding that such
practices can happen anywhere. With that in mind, we regularly review our
supply chain and audit all certified factories that we do substantial business
with to ensure that they show continued compliance with the Volcom Code of
Conduct and all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Our Code of Conduct
covers issues such as maximum working hours, fair wages, respect, equality, and
restriction of forced labor (amongst others).
* AUDITING *
Our verification practices include third-party audits of the entire factory,
including its dormitories. We work with Bureau Veritas for all our audits. The
auditing teams interview groups of workers, as well as individuals, without the
presence of their management, to allow them to comment on their working
conditions and any suspected abuse. We require every new factory in our supply
chain to present a recent, passing report from a third-party auditing firm or
other approved auditing body to comply with the requirements for our new
vendor/factory set-up.
Our audits are semi-unannounced in advance with a two-week window to give the
factory time to prepare for the visit and compile all the necessary
documentation. If an audit report ever brings up evidence regarding any
violations of the Code above, we work with the factory to create a Corrective
Action Plan clearly listing solutions with estimated completion dates for each
non- compliant point. If a re-audit is necessary, it is un-announced, and the
factory is given a two-week window. If we ever discover suspected child labor,
slave labor, or forced labor, we take immediate action to correct the issue and
send auditors in seven (7) days later to confirm that the factory is compliant.
Volcom schedules audits based on a factory's past audit result and risk level.
This can be scheduled every 7, 12, 18 or 24 months per Volcomâs discretion.
For a factory with a Volcom accepted certificate/brand audit, we are willing to
accept their certificates in lieu of a Volcom audit if we can review the full
report and track the completion of their Corrective Action Plan. These actions
help to verify that there is no human trafficking or slave labor in our supply
chain.
* CERTIFICATION AND CODE OF CONDUCT *
Every year Volcom updates its vendor manual with the current requirements, and
we require our entire supplier base to sign agreements noting that they have
read, understood, and implemented the requirements set forth. One of these
agreements is our Work Place Code of Conduct. The Volcom Work Place Code of
Conduct covers the following aspects (a copy of the Code can be found here):
Compliance with the Law
    * Employment Standards
    * Child Labor/Young Labor/Forced Labor
    * Health and Safety
    * Freedom of Association, Discrimination, and Disciplinary Practices
    * Working Hours and Compensation
    * Environment
    * C-TPAT (Customs Trade Pact Against Terrorism)
Additionally, our Vendor/Manufacturing Agreement specifically requires the
vendor/manufacturer to warrant and represent that "it is not engaged in, and
will not engage in any activities which are in violation of any applicable
domestic, foreign or international laws, rules, or regulations, including
without limitation, laws, rules or regulations governing labor."
Vendors agree to comply with the Code and to disclose the names and addresses
of every factory, contractor, and sub-contractor that they use to produce raw
materials and/or garments for Volcom. All of these factories, contractors, and
sub-contractors must also comply with the Code, otherwise our vendors are not
allowed to do business with them.
Lastly, the vendors agree to allow Volcom staff and representatives to inspect
the facilities to ensure compliance by visiting or conducting audits. Volcom
reserves the right to discontinue business with vendors who do not comply with
the Code or who work with factories, contractors, and sub-contractors that do
not comply.
* INTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY *
Volcom requires all new hires to sign and agree to comply with our Code of
Business Conduct & Ethics and Reporting Fraud. This Code specifically states
"Volcom employees must comply with all applicable labor and employment laws,
including anti-discrimination laws and laws related to freedom of association,
privacy and collective bargaining." If there is ever a violation of the Code,
employees have a duty to report the violation to their supervisor or department
head, or a member of the senior management. All reports are handled
anonymously.
The Code further explains how violations are handled: It is Volcomâs policy
that any employee who violates this Code will be subject to appropriate
discipline, including possible termination of employment. This determination
will be based upon the facts and circumstances of each particular situation. An
employee who is thought to have possibly violated this Code will be given an
opportunity to present his or her version of the events at issue prior to any
determination of appropriate discipline.
Volcom is in the process of educating our contractors and business partners on
the hazards of human trafficking and slavery, and encouraging them to
investigate their supply chains to eradicate this problem within their own
organizations.
* TRAINING *
Our Compliance Department continuously engages in online tutorials and webinars
to continue their training and deepen their knowledge regarding slavery and
human trafficking laws.
In addition to this online training, members of the design, merchandising,
production, compliance, and legal teams came together December 2, 2011 for a
Corporate Social Responsibility seminar hosted by Intertek, which focused on
identifying and mitigating risks in the supply chain, particularly regarding
factoriesâ employment practices. Volcom plans to continue this training by
conducting one-on-one meetings for new hires or for employees with new
responsibilities in the relevant area, as well as major group trainings
whenever there are new developments within slavery and human trafficking
enforcement.
Our auditing partners provide compliance seminars in China that our vendors can
attend. Vendors are always welcome to contact Volcomâs Compliance Department
at any time with regards to any compliance questions or concerns, and the
Department will work with them to resolve any issues they may have.
* CONSUMER EDUCATION *
Volcom has always been supportive of its most avid fans. We hope that our
customers are as dedicated to eradicating slavery and human trafficking as we
are. We would appreciate the opportunity to answer any questions regarding our
supply chain transparency and compliance procedures.
Volcom is pleased to present this information for compliance with The
California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, which we feel is a good tool to
enable companies to explain their personal efforts to eradicate the practice of
slave labor and human trafficking. Hopefully, with our fellow brandsâ help,
our combined statements will make a large impact on these dark areas of the
industry and help move us towards a fairer manufacturing future.
