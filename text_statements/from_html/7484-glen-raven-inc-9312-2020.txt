****** UNITED KINGDOM MODERN SLAVERY ACT - SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
STATEMENT ******
From starting as a textile mill in North Carolina in 1880, to becoming a
multinational company that focuses on enhancing life for global consumers
through innovative fabric-based, market-based solutions, Glen Raven has prided
itself on conducting business with integrity for over 135 years. Glen Raven
believes that human trafficking and slavery violate the most basic rights of
human beings and has zero tolerance for these practices. Consistent with this
belief, Glen Raven has taken the following steps:
    * Glen Ravenâs Code of Conduct, which is applicable to all company
      employees, prohibits all forms of human trafficking and slavery. During
      the past year, the Code of Conduct was provided to all new Glen Raven
      employees.
    * Glen Ravenâs Supplier_Code_of_Conduct prohibits its suppliers from
      engaging in any form of human trafficking or slavery. In addition,
      suppliers are prohibited from purchasing materials or services from
      companies that use forced or slave labor. The companyâs suppliers must
      also be able to certify that materials included in their products comply
      with the slavery and human trafficking laws in the countries in which
      they do business. During the past year, the Supplier Code of Conduct was
      made available to each new supplier via its publication on Glen Ravenâs
      website.
    * Although Glen Raven has not audited all of its suppliers with regard to
      slavery and human trafficking, the company has undertaken assessments of
      the business operations of certain suppliers. As part of the companyâs
      general oversight of its supply chain, Glen Raven employees conducted on-
      site visits to many of the companyâs major suppliers during the past
      year. If Glen Raven employees have reason to believe a supplier is
      engaged in human trafficking or the use of slave labor, including if the
      company receives credible information from third parties, the company
      will take immediate appropriate action.
    * During the past year, Glen Raven has developed a new training system for
      its employees. The system will enable targeted trainings of Glen Raven
      employees directly responsible for supply chain management on detecting
      and reporting human trafficking and slavery and on mitigating risks
      within the companyâs supply chain.
