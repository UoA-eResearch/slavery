SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Responsible Sourcing
James Perse strives to achieve and maintain high standards of corporate
integrity and ethical behavior in every aspect of our business. Further, we
expect business partners, suppliers, and contractors (collectively,
"Suppliers") who are involved in the manufacture of our products to conduct
their businesses not only in a lawful manner but also in compliance with the
same high standards of integrity and ethics we follow internally. Such
standards are set forth in the James Perse Enterprises, Inc. Supplier Code of
Conduct ("Code of Conduct").

The Code of Conduct sets forth important legal, ethical, behavioral, and other
requirements for parties who wish to be James Perse Suppliers in the following
areas: Transparent Recordkeeping Practices, Child Labor, Forced Labor, Fair
Compensation, Working Hours, Non-discrimination, Health and Safety, Freedom of
Association and Collective Bargaining, the Environment, Conflicts of Interest,
and Anti-bribery.

Suppliers must not only certify their own compliance with the Code of Conduct,
they must take all reasonable and necessary steps to ensure compliance by any
sub-contractors and sub-suppliers with whom they conduct business.
Additionally, James Perse requires all Suppliers to disseminate and communicate
the Code of Conduct to all their workers and supervisors.

James Perse also engages independent firms to conduct social and environmental
responsibility inspections of manufacturing facilities and to help facilitate
our social responsibility program. Thus, the Suppliers who manufacture our
products are regularly inspected to monitor compliance with our Code of Conduct
and applicable laws and regulations. All new Suppliers are subject to
inspection before we commence doing business. Suppliers are expected to
promptly take corrective action to address any identified deficiencies.
Although we endeavor to work with Suppliers to assist them in achieving
compliance (by, for example, providing informational resources and training),
James Perse reserves the right to terminate immediately its relationship with a
Supplier found to be in violation of the Code of Conduct.

James Perse also has established internal policies that apply to all James
Perse personnel, including employees, officers, and directors (collectively,
"Employees"). James Perse has communicated to Employees whose duties involve
our supply chain that they must comply with all applicable laws and regulations
and that our Suppliers must comply with the Code of Conduct. Employees who
require guidance on a legal or ethical question or who have witnessed or have
knowledge of illegal or unethical activity have been instructed to consult with
designated contacts within our company, depending on the specific
circumstances. All reports of alleged violations will be investigated.

California Transparency in Supply Chains Act
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires many
companies manufacturing or selling products in California to disclose their
efforts (if any) to address the issues of human trafficking and slavery,
thereby allowing consumers to make more informed choices regarding the products
they buy.

To address human trafficking and slavery in our supply chain, James Perse: (1)
engages in third-party verification to ensure that our supply chain is in
compliance with our Code of Conduct and all applicable laws regarding slavery
and human trafficking; (2) engages in independent audits of Suppliers to
confirm adherence to our standards regarding slavery and human trafficking; (3)
requires Suppliers to certify that the products they supply comply with both
the Code of Conduct and all applicable laws regarding slavery and human
trafficking in the country or countries in which they are doing business; (4)
holds Employees and Suppliers accountable to our standards regarding slavery
and human trafficking; and (5) trains Employees responsible for supply chain
management on mitigating the risk of human trafficking and slave labor.
