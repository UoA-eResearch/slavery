****** CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAIN ACT ******
Mount Vernon Mills, Inc. is meeting the requirements of the California
Transparency in Supply Chain Act of 2010. The information below sets forth the
actions we are taking to ensure our suppliers do not use slave labor or
otherwise engage in human trafficking. For the vast majority of our suppliers,
this is not an issue because their operations (and those of their suppliers, if
any) are located in the United States. They are already subject to the strict
standards under U.S. laws that prevent the use of slave labor. We believe our
efforts should be focused on our suppliers outside the U.S. For our suppliers
located in foreign countries, we use the procedures outlined below. In most
cases, our customers are also checking on our foreign suppliers, covering
health, safety, environmental and other social issues in addition to slave
labor and human trafficking.
Verification. Mount Vernon engages in verification activities to identify,
assess and manage the risks of human trafficking at its foreign suppliers. Our
verification program centers around audits conducted by both Mount Vernon
personnel as well as independent third party auditors. In almost all cases, our
customers are conducting their own verifications of our foreign suppliers as
well. Suppliers with failing results must address the shortcomings in a timely
manner, or they will no longer be used by Mount Vernon as a supplier.
Audit. As indicated above, Mount Vernon personnel and independent third party
auditors frequently conduct audits at our foreign suppliers. These audits may
be announced or unannounced. The audits cover a variety of compliance issues
including Mount Vernon’s prohibition against the use of slave labor and human
trafficking. Suppliers are required to correct any deficiencies, or else they
will no longer be used as our supplier. In addition, our customers are
conducting unannounced audits at the facilities in our foreign supply chain for
that customer. The prohibition against slave labor and human trafficking is a
major part of these audits. If non-compliance is found, we must work with the
affected facility to bring it back into compliance. If they cannot, we must
(and will) drop them as a supplier.
Certification. Mount Vernon has entered into Supplier Agreements with each of
its foreign suppliers. These agreements include provisions committing the
supplier to certify that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations, such as those prohibiting human trafficking. These agreements
further state that slave labor is not to be allowed in connection with any work
for Mount Vernon. Mount Vernon follows up using the audits discussed above to
ensure compliance with the agreement. In many cases, the supplier also has to
make certification to our customers that it is not using slave labor.
Internal Accountability. Issues like human trafficking are very important to
Mount Vernon. Making sure that Mount Vernon does not use suppliers that engage
in human trafficking is the responsibility of the Corporate Vice President &
Secretary. Company inspectors report on compliance issues (such as the slave
labor prohibition) to their managers, who in turn provide status reports to the
Corporate Vice President & Secretary. Also, all employees are encouraged to
bring compliance issues they discover to the attention of the Corporate Vice
President & Secretary. Mount Vernon maintains an “open door” policy so these
matters can be reported. The Corporate Vice President & Secretary makes the
final determination on responsive action in event of refusal to comply,
including termination of the supplier and notification of local authorities
where appropriate.
Training. The Corporate Vice President & Secretary regularly meets with Mount
Vernon managers and employees who work with foreign suppliers to discuss
compliance issues. The Corporate Vice President & Secretary also regularly
meets with the particular Mount Vernon managers with responsibility for foreign
supplier compliance, to ensure they understand their role in identifying,
assessing and managing compliance issues such as the slave labor prohibition.
Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations is an important, on-going
activity for Mount Vernon. This page will be updated as circumstances warrant.
