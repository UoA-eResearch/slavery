SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT

Introduction from the Chief Executive
Slavery and human trafficking remains a hidden blight on our global society. We
all have a responsibility to be alert to the risks, however small, in our
business and in the wider supply chain. Staff are expected to report concerns
and management are expected to act upon them.
Organisation's Structure
We are a group of leather manufacturing and associated companies. Scottish
Leather Group Limited is the parent company of wholly owned subsidiaries,
Andrew Muirhead & Son Limited, Bridge of Weir Leather Company Limited, NCT
Leather Limited, SLG Technology Limited and W.J & W. Lang Limited. The group
has its head office in the UK and all trading companies are in the UK. The
group has an annual turnover in excess of £120M.
Our Business
Our business is organised into five autonomous business units. We have zero
tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. We expect all those in our supply
chain and contractors to comply with our values. All directors are responsible
for compliance in their respective areas of responsibility and for their
supplier relationships.
Training
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and
human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, we provide training to
relevant members of staff. All directors have been briefed on the subject.
Our Effectiveness in Combating Slavery and Human Trafficking
We use the following key performance indicators (KPI's) to measure how
effective we have been to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not
taking place in any part of our business or supply chains:
Completion of business unit audits by directors and senior managers.
Use of labour monitoring and payroll systems; and
Level of communication and personal contact with the next link in the supply
chains and their understanding of, and compliance with, our expectations.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015
and constitutes our group's slavery and human trafficking statement for the
current financial year.
