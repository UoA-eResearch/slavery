Supply Chain Responsibility: California SB 657
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) requires
large manufacturers and retailers that sell goods in California to make certain
disclosures regarding their efforts to address slavery and human trafficking.
The Act is intended to ensure that retail manufactures and sellers are
disclosing their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their
supply chains.
Van de Velde is committed to observing high ethical standardsÂ  in the conduct
of its business.Â  We have earned the SA8000 label (www.sa-intl.org) which
draws on the basic conventions of the International Labour Organization, the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of
the Child.Â  We are committed to the goals of SB 657 and are committed to
compliance with all laws and regulations governing efforts to address slavery
and human trafficking.Â  In establishing and maintaining relationships with the
suppliers for our brands, we ask them to be committed to the samehigh_ethical
standards, and that are not linked to activities that would be considered
abusive or exploitive, including human trafficking and slavery. Â 
Van de Velde does engage in verification of our product supply chain to ensure
compliance with laws governing slavery and human trafficking.Â  These
verifications do not currently include a certification regarding the materials
used in manufacture by each supplier.Â  Verification is conducted by a third
party auditor pursuant to the SA_8000_standard.Â 
Â 
Van de Velde does have an internal accountability system to ensure compliance
with all laws and regulations regarding SA 8000.Â  Van de Velde conducts audits
of all crucial suppliers for its product brands.Â  The audits are announced.Â 
Van de Velde can take action upon discovery of violations, including requesting
a prompt redress of alleged violations, and corrective actions, as well as the
potential for termination of the supplier relationship in the event of
violations or failure to adequately remedy violations.Â Â Â  Â
