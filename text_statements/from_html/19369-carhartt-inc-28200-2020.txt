When our company was founded in 1889, Hamilton Carhartt talked about the role
of a responsible business in doing, "the just and honest thing, gainful if
possible". These core principles have underpinned Carhartt's approach to
business for more than 125 years and are as relevant today as they were in
1889.
Building on our roots as an American company, Carhartt products are today
manufactured and sold globally. Production is centered in company-owned
factories in the U.S. and Mexico, and in a network of supplier and licensee
factories around the world.
We are keenly aware of the environmental and human rights challenges presented
by global sourcing and we have taken a number of important steps to help ensure
that our principles are upheld throughout the global network of factories
supporting our business. Key steps include:
* Adopting a Workplace Code of Conduct that establishes expectations for all of
our supplier and licensee relationships. This Code provides key base line
expectations for environmental protection, responsible working conditions, and
fundamental human rights. It is based on the Core Conventions of the
International Labor Organization and the UN's Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
* In addition to these third-party assessments, Carhartt sourcing and quality
assurance personnel visit and work in supplier facilities on an ongoing basis.
These individuals have been trained on responsible workplace conditions and
Carhartt's expectations for suppliers. The regular presence of Carhartt
personnel at supplier facilities allows us to closely monitor day-to-day work
conditions supplementing periodic audits by WRAP or other third-parties.

Media Inquiries:
Other Inquiries:
In September of 2010, the state of California enacted legislation requiring all
companies doing business in the state to disclose information on the actions
being taken to address the risks of human trafficking and slavery in their
global supply chains. Shown below are Carhartt's responses to the five required
disclosures outlined in the legislation:
   1. Verification -- All factories producing goods for Carhartt are required
      to comply with the Company's Workplace Code of Conduct, which includes a
      specific "prohibition of involuntary, prison, or forced labor -
      indentured, bonded or otherwise" and a methodology to verify compliance
      with labor standards. All suppliers also are expected to meet the
      standards of the US Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT),
      including recommended safeguards protecting against the introduction of
      non-manifested cargo. These expectations extend to all sub-contractors.
      Verification takes place through third-party assessment of responsible
      labor conditions, using the Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production
      (WRAP) protocol, or a similar third-party factory certification approach.
   2.
   3. Audit -Responsible labor practices are confirmed through third-party
      factory assessments, using the Worldwide Responsible Accredited
      Production (WRAP) social audit protocol, or a similar third-party factory
      certification approach. Supplier audits are conducted by reputable third-
      party assessment firms and are unannounced within a 30-day window. These
      audits evaluate present factory conditions as well as the policies,
      procedures and management systems which are necessary for ongoing
      compliance.
   4.
   5. Certification-- Carhartt's Workplace Code of Conduct requires all of our
      suppliers to comply fully with all local laws, including those related to
      slavery and human trafficking. In the event local laws are not robust,
      Carhartt's Workplace Code of Conduct further prohibits suppliers from
      using "involuntary, prison, or forced labor - indentured, bonded or
      otherwise." Suppliers certify that they understand and comply with these
      expectations before starting Carhartt production and periodically
      thereafter.
   6.
   7. Internal Accountability-- Responsible labor conditions have been a core
      value at Carhartt for more than 125 years. Internal accountability
      resides with the leadership of the core business functions responsible
      for the relevant commercial relationships - e.g., the Sourcing function
      for all relationships with cut and sew suppliers and the Licensing
      Department for all license agreements. All Carhartt contractors and
      licensees must adhere to our Code and maintain appropriate third-party
      certifications.
      If an audit demonstrates that a contractor does not comply with
      Carhartt's Code of Conduct, we take appropriate remedial action. While we
      prefer to work with contractors to achieve improved conditions,
      violations involving human trafficking or slavery would be considered
      "zero tolerance" issues that must be immediately corrected or Carhartt
      would act to terminate the contractual relationship.
   8.
   9. Training-- With support from WRAP, Carhartt has conducted training on the
      Company's Workplace Code of Conduct - including provisions related to
      human trafficking and slavery. Individuals completing this training
      include supply chain leadership from the Vice President through the
      manager level in our Sourcing and Quality Assurance activities. Select
      individuals in our Customs activity also have completed the training. We
      are presently in the process of extending the training to others within
      our organization.
Carhartt, Inc.
(Revised October 3, 2018)
As a premium brand, Carhartt is committed to conducting business in a fair and
ethical manner. Carharttâs Social Compliance Departmentâs Mission is To
serve and protect the hardworking people who make our products. Consistent with
this Mission, Carhartt has established this Code of Conduct as a minimum set of
standards for Carhartt suppliers. Carharttâs Code is based on internationally
accepted labor standards, including the International Labor Organizationâs
Core Conventions and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. While this Code
establishes minimum standards, Carhartt aspires to partner with companies that
share Carharttâs corporate values and are committed to continuous process
improvements as it relates to social and environmental practices. Any questions
or concerns, or any alleged violations, should be emailed to
factorycompliance@carhartt.com.
Scope
As used herein, the term supplier
 is defined broadly to cover the range of Carharttâs supply chain partners,
including cut and sew suppliers providing finished garments, direct and
nominated suppliers of fabrics, trims and other raw materials, licensed
partnersâ facilities, transportation and logistics providers and other supply
chain partners. The term supplier also applies to the authorized subcontractors
used by Carhartt direct suppliers, including, but not limited to, laundry,
screen print, printing, embroidery or other embellishments or processes.
Suppliers with which Carhartt has a direct contractual relationship are
expected to extend these standards to all of their suppliers and to initiate
practices to assure that these standards are adopted throughout the global
supply network supporting Carhartt.
The consequences of non-compliance by suppliers with the standards outlined in
Carharttâs Code of Conduct may include, but are not limited to, cancellation
of existing orders or loss of all future business with Carhartt. Carharttâs
process for approving and ensuring compliance to the Code of Conduct is
outlined in Appendix A.
Code_of_Conduct
1._Employment_Relationship â Carhartt suppliers will adopt and adhere to the
rules and conditions of employment that respect workers and, at a minimum,
safeguard their rights under national and international labor and social
security laws and regulations.
2._Compliance_with_Laws_and_Workplace_Regulations â Carhartt suppliers will
comply with laws and regulations in all locations where they conduct business
including those relating to labor, social insurances/security, worker health
and safety, and the environment. It is further expected that suppliers will
cooperate fully with Carhartt in its compliance with laws applicable to
Carhartt in countries where Carhartt does business. Where local law or
standards differ or conflict, the highest standard shall apply.
3._Prohibition_of_Forced_Labor â Carhartt suppliers will not hire any
employees under the age of 15, or under the age interfering with compulsory
schooling, or under the minimum age established by law, whichever is greater.
Supplier must maintain official and verifiable age documentation for each
worker.
4._Prohibition_of_Child_Labor â Carhartt suppliers will not hire any
employees under the age of 15, or under the age interfering with compulsory
schooling, or under the minimum age established by law, whichever is greater.
Supplier must maintain official and verifiable age documentation for each
worker.
5._Prohibition_of_Harassment_or_Abuse â Carhartt suppliers will endeavor to
establish workplaces where every employee is treated with respect and dignity.
No employee shall be subjected to any physical, sexual, psychological or verbal
harassment, abuse, corporal punishment, or monetary fines.
6._Prohibition_of_Discrimination â Carhartt suppliers will employ, pay,
promote, and terminate workers on the basis of their ability to do the job,
rather than on the basis of personal characteristics or beliefs. No person
shall be subject to any discrimination in employment, including hiring,
compensation, advancement, discipline, termination or retirement, on the basis
of gender, race, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, nationality,
political opinion, social group or ethnic origin.
7._Freedom_of_Association_&_Collective_Bargaining â Carhartt suppliers shall
recognize and respect the right of employees to freedom of association and
collective bargaining.
8._Compensation_and_Benefits â Carhartt suppliers will pay at least the
minimum total compensation required by local law, including all mandated wages,
allowances, and benefits, as well as required pay for overtime and holiday
work. Supplier must maintain adequate and verifiable payroll documentation and
each employee must be provided with a clear, written accounting for each pay
period.
9._Hours_of_Work â Carhartt suppliers will conform to hours worked each day,
and days worked each week, that do not exceed the legal limitations of the
countries in which they operate. At a minimum, Suppliers will provide at least
one day (24 hours) off in every seven-day period, except as required to meet
urgent business needs. Suppliers are encouraged to control total weekly hours
to 60 or less for all employees. All overtime hours must be worked voluntarily.
10._Health_and_Safety â Carhartt suppliers must ensure that their employees
are provided with a safe and healthy work environment, including any housing
and cafeteria requirements, and are not subject to hazardous or unsanitary
conditions.
11._Multi-Tenant â Carhartt production is prohibited in factories with more
than one tenant unless Carharttâs Multi-Tenant Policy is fully complied with
(Appendix B)
12._Sandblasting â Unique challenges exist with working conditions and with
worker health and safety in the denim finishing process in laundries and
facilities. In view of health concerns related to the use of sandblasting in
garment processing, sandblasting processes are not permitted at any facilities
that produce Carhartt products.
13._Environmental â Carhartt suppliers will comply with environmental rules,
regulations and standards applicable to their operations, and will adopt
responsible measures to mitigate negative impacts that the workplace has on the
environment. This includes hazardous waste disposal, waste management
practices, air emissions, water treatment and other significant environmental
risks.
14._Procurement_Ethics â Carharttâs business relationship with its
suppliers is based solely on the supplierâs merits in the way of prices,
excellent quality, prompt delivery and efficient services. Therefore, no
payments, gifts, rewards or gratuities of any kind shall be made directly or
indirectly to Carhartt employees or Carharttâs buying agent or staff members
in consideration of the business being placed with supplier.
15._Bribery_and_Corruption â Carhartt suppliers will not, in connection with
any aspect of their business with Carhartt, directly or indirectly give or
offer any bribe, kickback or other improper payment or benefit to influence
another individual, company, organization, government official or body, or
political party or candidate, regardless of whether it is officially tolerated
or condoned.
16._Transparency â Honesty and transparency is critical for a relationship
with Carhartt. Supplier is required to provide accurate and truthful answers to
any questions or documents requested by Carhartt. The use of falsified records,
double books or similar documents, or coached/instructed employee interviews
can and will result in the disqualification of the Supplier from future
business with Carhartt.
17._Subcontracting â Carhartt will not tolerate the unauthorized
subcontracting of any or all production operations associated with the
manufacture of Carhartt products. Carhartt suppliers must disclose any
subcontracted processes prior to production and receive written approval from
Carhartt for the use of subcontracted services; including, but not limited to,
laundry, screen print, embroidery or other embellishments or processes.
Carhartt also specifically prohibits the practice of âHome Workâ as a means
of producing its product. Subcontractors will be required to meet the same
Carhartt Workplace Code of Conduct as primary Carhartt suppliers. Approval is
specific to individual subcontractor locations. Any unauthorized subcontracting
may result in the immediate cancellation of all open orders or other business
relationships between Supplier and Carhartt.
18._Migrant_Labor â Any supplier using Migrant Labor is required to adopt the
Carhartt Policy on Migrant Labor (Appendix C), or draft their own policy that
includes the Carhartt policy requirements as a minimum, no later than March 31,
2019. Any violations found related to migrant workers hired after March 31,
2019 will require the supplier to reimburse all inappropriate fees charged to
the migrant worker. The policy includes the following critical requirements, in
addition to other guidance.
●   All employment contracts and other work related information must be
truthful, clearly written and provided in the workerâs native language
●   Workers must be provided with contracts and wages that equal or exceed
those of local workers per the policy, and must be treated equally in the
workplace.
●   Workers should not pay any recruitment fees or other related employment
fees from country of employment or home country â including transportation to
and from the host country per the policy.
●   Workers shall retain possession and control of their personal identity
documents, such as passports, identity papers, travel documents, and other
personal legal documents at all times
19._Animal_Welfare â Carhartt believes that every animal deserves to be free
from hunger and thirst, discomfort, pain, injury or disease, fear and distress.
The belief is that this should last for an animal's entire lifetime, including
birth, growth/rearing/breeding, feed/water/shelter, transport and slaughter. No
animal used for the production of Carhartt products should be intentionally
harmed or exposed to pain. Taking the lives of animals should be conducted
using the quickest and the least painful and non-traumatic methods available.
Carhartt may request specific information on the Supplierâs supply chain
related to the conditions imposed on animals used for certain materials (e.g.
down, leather, wool).
20._Source_of_Cotton_Fiber â Due to Uzbekistan and Turkmenistanâs ongoing
use of forced labor and child labor in growing and harvesting cotton, Carhartt
has joined with many other brands in pledging to not knowingly use Uzbek and/or
Turkmen sourced cotton in products. Suppliers are required to ensure that Uzbek
and/or Turkmen cotton is excluded from the supply chain. Carhartt will
periodically request suppliers to attest that cotton fiber is not Uzbek and/or
Turkmen sourced (Appendix D). In some cases, suppliers may not know where
cotton is grown and, in those cases, suppliers will be asked to provide
information on their sources for fabrics, yarns and threads.
21._Customs_Compliance â Carhartt suppliers will comply with applicable
customs law and, in particular, will establish and maintain programs to comply
with customs laws regarding illegal transshipment of apparel products.
22._Security â Carhartt suppliers will maintain facility security procedures
to guard against the introduction of non-manifested cargo into outbound
shipments (e.g. drugs, explosives, biohazards, and/or other contraband).
Suppliers are further expected to cooperate with Carhartt in meeting C-TPAT and
other supply chain security requirements established by U.S. Customs and Border
Protection or other governmental security requirements.
23._Right_to_Audit â Carhartt reserves the right to visit the production or
other facilities where Carhartt product is produced or handled at any time.
These visits may be conducted by Carhartt employees or by third-party auditors
retained by Carhartt. Visits may be announced, semi-announced or unannounced.
Any denied access to a facility will be considered a Zero Tolerance violation.
24._Visibility_of_Carhartt_Code_of_Conduct â A copy of Carharttâs Workplace
Code of Conduct (first 4 pages) must be posted in strategic locations at the
supplierâs place of business (i.e. lobby, near time clocks, bulletin board,
etc.) so that each member of the supplierâs organization has access to the
policy. The policy should be translated into the native languages of all
workers and be located so that employees can read and understand Carharttâs
policy. Supplier is to provide Carhartt with a copy of any translation.
                                   *********
As noted in this Code of Conduct, Carhartt aspires to partner with companies
that share its corporate values and are committed to continuous improvement of
social and environmental practices. It is our intent that the standards
outlined in this Workplace Code of Conduct be applied throughout the global
network of vendors involved in the development, manufacture and transport of
Carhartt products. Vendors with which Carhartt has a direct contractual
relationship are expected to extend these standards to all sub-tier suppliers
and to initiate practices to assure that aligned standards are adopted
throughout the global supply network supporting Carhartt.
At Carhartt, we pride ourselves on working with like-minded organizations that
align with our brand and business. Carhartt supports 501(c)(3) nonprofit
organizations whose mission statements align with our own by providing in-kind
product donations to assist with charitable efforts. We do not accept
unsolicited requests for financial contributions.

We prefer to donate apparel to organizations that focus on supporting disaster
relief and workforce development. True to our work wear roots, our community
affairs program exists to assist those in need by providing product that will
allow them return to work with durable apparel to protect them from the
elements. Click_here to learn more about our community affairs program.

Special consideration is given to organizations in Michigan, Kentucky and
Tennessee, where we have long-established facilities and deep ties to the
community.

All requests must be submitted to Carhartt through our online_donation_request
system. We no longer accept requests via other methods.

Thank you for your interest in partnering with Carhartt.

Carhartt has always been dedicated to the protection of our consumers. As we
continue to expand into the global market, it is more important than ever.
Carhartt works hard to ensure that our garments are designed and manufactured
responsibly, and that any chemicals used are safe for our consumers as well as
all workers in our supply chain factories.

Years ago, Carhartt adopted the Restricted Substance List as a product
specification. This list is maintained by the American Apparel and Footwear
Association and is accessible as a public document. The list represents current
global standards for the industry and is updated twice annually to ensure
conformance with global consumer protection standards. By focusing first and
foremost on protecting Carhartt consumers, we are in turn protecting the
Carhartt brand.

Any inquiries regarding general conformity certifications under the Consumer
Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 should be directed to Carharttâs
website.
