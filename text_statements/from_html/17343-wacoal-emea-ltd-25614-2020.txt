****** Wacoal Europe Modern Slavery Policy ******
At Wacoal Europe we have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery. We are
committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking in our operation and
supply chain.
All of our direct employ operations across the globe comply with legal
requirements for the employment of and remuneration of all employees.
All of Wacoal Europe’s garments are made in factories which are 100% owned by
the Wacoal Group, joint ventures with local companies or with partners of long
standing relationship. We deal directly with those factories and never through
agents or 3rd parties.
Our direct supplier selection and on-boarding procedure includes due diligence
of the supplier's reputation, respect for the law, compliance with health,
safety and environmental standards, and references.
We require our suppliers to endorse such principles to demonstrate their
opposition to human trafficking and modern day slavery and to comply with the
ETI base code.
