****** California Transparency
in Supply Chains Act of 2010 ******
Glen Raven believes that human trafficking and slavery violate the most basic
rights of human beings and has zero tolerance for these practices. In
accordance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, we
support:
    * Evaluation and verification of risks of human trafficking and slavery in
      product supply chains.Â Glen Raven prohibits human trafficking and
      slavery by Glen Raven and all of our suppliers. We will audit our
      suppliers to ensure that our supply chain conforms to this prohibition
      and may seek additional verification where warranted. These audits and
      verifications are not performed by third parties.
    * Audits of suppliers.Â While Glen Raven has inspected some suppliers with
      respect to the manner in which they conduct business, we have not yet
      audited all suppliers regarding slavery and human trafficking topics.
      Glen Raven employees have conducted on-site visits to our major
      suppliers. If we receive credible information indicating slavery or human
      trafficking at a supplier, we will take immediate appropriate action.
      Glen Raven will be developing a system for determining the necessity of
      on-site audits and trusted supplier recognition as we choose.
    * Certification requirements for direct suppliers.Â Glen Raven will require
      suppliers to certify that their compliance with the laws regarding
      slavery and human trafficking of the countries in which they are doing
      business.
    * Internal accountability standards and procedures.Â Glen Raven maintains
      an employee Code of Conduct prohibiting illegal and unethical behavior.
      We are adopting standards and procedures to deal appropriately with
      employees and contractors failing to meet our standards regarding slavery
      and trafficking.
    * Employee Training.Â We are developing a training program to educate Glen
      Raven employees directly responsible for supply chain management on
      detecting and reporting human trafficking and slavery and mitigating
      risks within our supply chains.
