Modern_Slavery_Statement
***** Modern Slavery Statement *****
This statement relates to the financial year from March 2017 to February 2018.
A successful global clothing retailer, at T.M.Lewin we run our business
responsibly. We are committed to understanding modern slavery risks across the
organisation and to ensuring that there is no modern slavery in our business or
our supply chain. We work hard to respect the human rights of everyone we work
with and to maintain the highest ethical standards.
Founded in 1898 when Thomas Mayes Lewin (T.M.Lewin) opened his first shop in
Jermyn Street in London, our company has a long history. T.M.Lewin now has just
under 100 stores in the UK, with new stores opening in countries across the
world.
We trade in Europe, Australia, South East Asia, US and Africa and our suppliers
are based in Europe and across Asia. T.M.Lewin has a responsibility to be alert
to and respond to risks associated with modern slavery in these locations.
We take this responsibility seriously, ensuring all factories and suppliers
that we work with are audited by an independent third party. These audits
comply with the international industry standards set by the International
Labour Organization (ILO). The main aims of the ILO are to promote rights at
work, encourage decent employment opportunities, enhance social protection and
strengthen dialogue on work-related issues, including Modern Slavery.
All new suppliers are rigorously checked at T.M.Lewin. They are required to
produce an independent audit report covering key areas such as Health and
Safety, working hours and practices and child labour which comply with ILO
standards. Where no report exists, T.M.Lewin will commission an independent
third party audit before commencing work with the supplier. All suppliers must
agree to T.M.Lewinâs comprehensive audit programme as part of the terms and
conditions agreement to work with T.M.Lewin.
Audit programmes highlight good working practices as well as areas of concern.
T.M.Lewin investigates all areas of non-compliance with suppliers, working with
them to agree and deliver immediate action to address all issues. We will
terminate a supplier agreement where non-compliance is not rectified.
We are committed to maintaining a high level of understanding of and managing
the risks of modern slavery in our supply chain and across the wider T.M.Lewin
business. This statement has been approved by the Board of Directors at
T.M.Lewin.
