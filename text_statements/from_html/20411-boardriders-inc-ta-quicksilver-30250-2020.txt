***** Modern Slavery Act Statement *****
This statement sets out Boardriders UK’s (as defined below) ongoing commitment
as a responsible business to ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking
is eradicated, in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
 
**** Introduction ****
The Boardriders Group is a retail sporting goods business and one of the
world's largest manufacturers of surf wear and other board-sport related
products. The Boardriders Group designs, develops and distributes a large range
of branded clothing, footwear, accessories and other products under the
Quiksilver, Roxy, DC Shoes brands whose images and names are closely associated
with boardriding sports and lifestyle.
 
The Boardriders Group has over 5,000 employees worldwide and operates in 90
countries. The global business is managed from three main regions: the
"Americas" region managed from our group headquarters by the US parent company
Boardriders Inc.; the "Europe, Middle East, Africa" (EMEA) region managed by
the French subsidiary NA PALI SAS; and the "Asia-Pacific" (APAC) region managed
by the Australian subsidiary UG Manufacturing Co. Pty. Ltd.
 
Boardriders Group EMEA business is organised into over 30 different corporate
entities in 18 countries, including the United Kingdom. The Boardriders Group
UK subsidiary of NA PALI SAS is LANAI Ltd., which is located in London and
operates our commercial activity in the UK, including e-commerce (NA PALI SAS
and LANAI Ltd are collectively referred to as “Boardriders UK”).
 
**** Our supply chains ****
The Boardriders Group works with over 80 manufacturers in Asia, Europe and the
Middle East, who supply our warehouses in the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions
with surf wear and other board-sport related products for sale throughout over
90 countries.
 
We are conscious that imported products or services sourced from outside the UK
or EC are potentially more at risk of slavery or human trafficking issues. If
products have to be sourced from such locations, we will look favourably on
suppliers who can demonstrate a commitment to human rights and fair working
conditions.
 
**** Our policies on slavery and human trafficking ****
The Boardriders Group is committed to conducting business in an ethical manner
and expects its manufacturing partners to share this same commitment.
Accordingly, Boardriders Group established a global ethical program in 2004
titled “QUEST” (Quiksilver Ethical Standards of Trade), to prevent abusive,
exploitive, or illegal conditions in the workplace and prevent human
trafficking and slavery. QUEST reflects our commitment to acting ethically and
with integrity in all our business relationships. QUEST includes a Supplier
Workplace Code of Conduct, and all agents, vendors and factories are required
to participate in the QUEST program as a condition of doing business with our
companies.
 
Boardriders Group also has in place a robust whistleblowing procedure for the
submission of complaints or concerns, as well as a Code of Business Conduct and
Ethics, both designed to encourage and to protect anyone who wishes to raise
concerns about wrongdoing within our business.
 
**** Due diligence processes for slavery and human trafficking ****
Boardriders Group recruitment processes are transparent and reviewed regularly.
We communicate directly with candidates to discuss job opportunities and to
confirm the details of any offer made. We have robust procedures in place for
the vetting of new employees and ensure that we are able to confirm their
identities and that they are paid directly into an appropriate, personal bank
account.
 
If we discover that any of our employees have been complicit in human
trafficking or modern slavery, we will take the appropriate disciplinary action
against them. Non-compliance with our QUEST standards, falling short of modern
slavery, can result in a Corrective Action Plan (CAP). Under CAP, our employees
and contractors are expected to follow a series of steps to correct their non-
compliance in order for them to remain an active employee or contractor.
Otherwise, they face termination.
 
We have implemented a number of processes to ensure, as reasonably practicable,
that our supply chains adhere to our expectations in respect of their
workforce. Annually, we evaluate all of our direct manufacturing suppliers to
verify that they are not at risk for violating anti-slavery and human
trafficking laws. Our own internal QUEST team spearheads that verification
process, using an internally developed assessment tool. This tool helps us to
categorize suppliers using a grading matrix system aligned to each clause of
Boardriders’ Supplier Workplace Code of Conduct. This is a risk-profiling
process in order to grade suppliers and alert management if a violation is
detected, so that immediate action can be taken including termination with the
supplier to protect the supply chain. We also rely on input from our
independent factory auditors, particularly in jurisdictions where there is a
higher risk of modern slavery, to assess these risks and vulnerabilities.
 
All of our new suppliers need to be audited with acceptable audit results prior
to cooperation with Boardriders Group. We continue to monitor all of our
supplier behaviour and compliance with QUEST, notably every year in high risk
countries (as defined by World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators), through
an independent external contractor who carries out unannounced audits and also
by ongoing monitoring. This is the only way that suppliers can maintain their
“active” status with Boardriders Group. We have committed to work only with
organisations who share our values and who have pledged to assist in the
eradication of slavery and human trafficking.
 
As with Employees and contractors, all suppliers are issued with a Corrective
Action Plan following an audit. Our QUEST team works with suppliers throughout
the assessment process and factory management is educated and assisted on any
non-compliance issue encountered during an applicable audit. If appropriate, if
following an audit we do not see progress to resolving any non-compliance
issues in the CAP, the supplier will face termination.
 
To ensure that our suppliers respect and enforce our QUEST standards, the
commercial agreements governing our contractual relationship stipulate that our
suppliers must abide by our QUEST standards, or the contractual relationship is
subject to termination. More specifically, we ask our suppliers to agree to
provide workers with a safe and healthy work environment; allow workers freedom
of association and collective bargaining; conduct business in compliance with
applicable environmental, labour, and employment laws; refrain from corrupt
practices; and protect against human trafficking and slavery. We also require
our suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into our products comply
with applicable laws, including those laws that relate to slavery and human
trafficking in the country or countries in which they do business.
 
We take a zero tolerance approach to human trafficking and modern slavery. We
will not work or continue to work with any organisation that we find has been
knowingly involved in either human trafficking or modern slavery.
 
**** Training ****
As part of our efforts to ensure compliance with our QUEST standards and
prevent abusive, exploitive, or illegal conditions in the workplace, our QUEST
department conducts ongoing internal employee and management training regarding
our code and human rights concerns, including human trafficking and slavery
associated with our supply chains. The training specifically covers mitigating
risks of human trafficking and slavery within our company’s supply chains of
products, and is mandatory for those company employees and management who have
direct responsibility for supply chain management.
 
**** Our effectiveness in combating slavery and human trafficking ****
At Boardriders UK and within the Boardriders Group (via a specific group
affiliate that takes responsibility for modern slavery matters), we shall take
the responsibility for implementing this policy statement and its objectives
and shall provide adequate resources and investment to ensure that slavery and
human trafficking is not taking place within the organisation or within its
supply chains.
 
We will continue to monitor this policy and review QUEST in relation to slavery
and human trafficking. If we become aware of any breaches of QUEST or any
necessary update or additional to this policy, we will investigate and take
such steps as are necessary to ensure that the risk of further breaches
occurring is minimised.
 
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015
and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial
year ending on October 31st 2017.
