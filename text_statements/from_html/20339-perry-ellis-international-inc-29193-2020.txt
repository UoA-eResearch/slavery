*** California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657) ***
On January 1, 2012, the state of California enacted the California Transparency
in Supply Chains Act (SB 657). This Act seeks to eradicate slavery and human
trafficking from product supply chains. Perry Ellis International, Inc. has a
Vendor Code of Conduct that strictly prohibits the use of forced or compulsory
labor of any kind, including prison labor, bonded labor, indentured labor,
slavery and human trafficking. To address the regulations of the Act, we are
taking the following steps:
    * Verification: Perry Ellis International, Inc. ("PEI") is committed to
      fair labor practices within our supply chain. Part of PEIâs robust
      Social Compliance program is to assess and verify the risk of slavery and
      human trafficking within its supply chain. PEI conducts its risk
      assessment by country by reviewing the US Department of Stateâs
      Trafficking in Persons Report located at http://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/
      tiprpt/index.htm which is issued on an annual basis, wherein country-
      specific risk level assignments are based on a three-tier ranking of the
      local government's compliance with the Trafficking Victims Protection
      Act. Risk assessment is performed internally by PEI. All direct suppliers
      are reviewed by PEIâs Social Compliance Department prior to production
      placement.
    * Audit: PEI conducts regular audits of its direct suppliers. PEI has
      established a Vendor Code of Conduct which is issued to its direct
      suppliers. Direct suppliers are evaluated on their compliance of our code
      through announced and unannounced audits conducted by PEI's internal
      auditors and third party audit providers.
    * Certification: As a condition of doing business, PEI requires its direct
      suppliers to certify in writing via the PEI Master Supply Agreement that
      they comply with all applicable laws within the country of business
      including those regarding slavery and human trafficking as well as PEI's
      Vendor Code of Conduct.
    * Accountability: PEI maintains and enforces internal accountability
      procedures for PEI employees and compliance by direct suppliers regarding
      company standards on slavery and human trafficking. In the case of non-
      compliance PEI reserves the right to investigate the situation and
      develop a best possible strategy for resolution. If non-compliance
      continues unresolved within a timely manner, PEI may terminate the
      business relationship.
    * Training: PEI conducts internal training on its Vendor Code of Conduct to
      ensure the necessary participants in the supply chain management are
      knowledgeable and aware of the issues and concerns surrounding the supply
      chain, involving human trafficking and slavery including mitigating risks
      within the supply chain of products sourced by PEI. PEI also encourages
      employees involved in PEI's supply chain to participate in external
      training programs and seminars on social compliance issues.
