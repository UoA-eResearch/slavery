****** Modern Slavery Act 2015: Slavery & Human Trafficking Statement ******
**** Introduction from the CEO ****
 
We are committed to maintaining the highest standards and continually improving
our practices to combat slavery and human trafficking. Modern slavery is a
crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It takes various forms, such
as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all
of which have in common the deprivation of a person’s liberty by another in
order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. We have a zero-tolerance
approach to modern slavery and we are committed to acting ethically and with
integrity in all our business dealings and relationships by implementing and
enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking
place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains.
 
We are also committed to ensuring that there is transparency in our own
business and in our approach to tackling modern slavery throughout our supply
chains, consistent with our disclosure obligations under the Modern Slavery Act
2015. We expect the same high standards from all of our contractors, suppliers
and other business partners, and as part of our contracting process, we seek
specific assurances against the use of forced, compulsory or trafficked labour,
or anyone held in slavery or servitude, whether adults or children, and we
expect that our suppliers will hold their own suppliers to the same high
standards.
 
**** Organisation’s Structure and Business ****
 
We are a global reinforcement textile manufacturer supplying products across a
wide range of industrial sectors. We have manufacturing plants in the UK and
the USA and employ in excess of 250 people globally. We operate through James
Dewhurst Ltd and Dewtex Inc. manufacturing woven and non-woven textile products
used for reinforcement in a wide range of applications.
 
**** Our Supply Chains ****
 
Our supply chain consists of established and reputable suppliers based around
the world who are well known within the technical textiles industry. The
majority of the yarns we purchase originate from Asia with the remainder coming
from Europe or the USA.
 
**** Our Policies on Slavery and Human Trafficking ****
 
We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human
trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Our Anti-
Slavery Policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity
in all our business relationships, and to implementing and enforcing effective
systems and controls to counter slavery and human trafficking in our supply
chains.
 
**** Due Diligence Processes for Slavery and Human Trafficking ****
 
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk we will seek
confirmation from our suppliers that they condemn Modern Slavery. We have a
Whistleblowing Policy to enable employees to report any suspected instances
with confidence. In addition, we are currently reviewing our need to: –
    * Identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply chains;
    * Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our
      supply chains;
    * Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains.
 
**** Supplier Adherence ****
 
We have zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. To ensure that all
those in our supply chain, including contractors, comply we have implemented a
supply chain compliance programme. This is currently being rolled out and forms
part of our Supplier Approval Process.
 
**** Training ****
 
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and
human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, we will ensure that
our policy is communicated throughout our organisation and will provide
guidance to all appropriate existing and new employees.
 
**** Our Effectiveness in Combating Slavery and Human Trafficking ****
 
Further Steps
Following a review of the effectiveness of the steps we have taken so far to
ensure that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains we
intend to: –
    * Continue rolling out our compliance programme to all suppliers
    * Investigate methods of monitoring including developing KPIâs to assist
      in measuring our effectiveness in combating Modern Slavery.
 
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015
and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for the Financial
Year ending 31st March 2016.
