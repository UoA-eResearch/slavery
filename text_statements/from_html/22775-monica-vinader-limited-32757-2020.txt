****** Monica Vinader Modern Slavery Act Statement ******
Introduction
Monica Vinader maintains a longstanding commitment to responsible and
sustainable business practices, including respect for human rights. Â As a
member of the Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC), we have signed up to supply
chain principles and associated safeguards prescribed by the RJC, including
independent auditing of supply chains and the furthering of ethical and
environmentally-sustainable operations.
We welcome the transparency that the Modern Slavery Act requires, and we are
committed to combating slavery, forced labour, human trafficking and other
unlawful and/or unethical practices throughout our business and our supply
chains.
Organizationâs Structure and Business
Since its debut in 2008, Monica Vinader has developed an internationally-
renowned luxury jewellery brand, operating from office space in Norfolk and
London, and boutiques globally as well as on-line. Â The Company has since won
Brand of the Year at the UK Jewellery Awards, and its products are now stocked
by global luxury retailers including Harrods, Selfridges, Liberty, Net-A-Porter
and Nordstrom. Â 
Our Supply Chain
One of our core values is respect for all those with whom we work. Our supply
chain encompasses the provision of goods and services, both within and outside
the U.K. Â We engage with approximately 7 suppliers of valuable metals,
gemstones and diamonds used in the manufacture of our products (âProduct
Suppliersâ). Â Such Product Suppliers currently operate factories operating
in India, Thailand and Italy. Â 
Our Commitment to Human Rights
Monica Vinader is committed to ensuring there is no slavery, forced labour or
human trafficking occurring in our supply chains, or indeed any other part of
our business. Â 
We expect our employees to uphold the firmâs core values of excellence,
integrity and social responsibility encompassed in our Responsible Business
Policy and RJC Codes. Â In addition, we actively encourage employees to raise
any behaviors or activities they believe to be unlawful or unethical in any
part of our business or operations.
We also expect all our suppliers to adhere to the highest legal and ethical
standards, and to operate free from discrimination, slavery, forced labour and
human trafficking. Â 
We aim to ensure our Product Suppliers in particular meet these high standards
by a combination of the following:
1. Supplier Social Compliance
All suppliers undergo an annual workplace conditions assessment (WCA) audit,
conducted by Intertek. Â WCA is a social compliance audit which tracks and
evaluates key areas such as labour, wages, health and safety, management
systems and environment conditions (http://www.intertek.com/business-assurance/
supplier-management/workplace-conditions/). Â Our suppliers are notified of any
non-conformance concerns and performance is monitored appropriately including
follow up audits, to ensure that standards are met. Â Audits are undertaken at
least every 12 months.
2. Supplier Visibility
Consistent with standard anti-corruption/bribery practices, we believe firmly
in the value of due diligence, and the importance of getting to know our
suppliers well in order to build long-term relationships based on trust and
integrity. Â To that end, we employ two full-time Quality Assurance Project
Managers working on the ground collaboratively with our manufacturers in [India
and Thailand]. Â We also schedule regular visits, at least quarterly, by our
UK-based Supplier Management team.
3. Contractual Clauses
Our supplier agreement further requires our suppliers to confirm that they have
not been investigated for, or convicted of, offences involving corruption of
breach of human rights laws and standards. Â In addition, suppliers are
required to implement their own transparent due diligence programmes in order
to ensure that none of their sub-contractors or suppliers are engaged directly
or indirectly in slavery or human trafficking.
Next Steps
We will continue periodically to assess the issues of slavery and human
trafficking within our organization.
Signed
Gabriela Vinader, Managing Director
