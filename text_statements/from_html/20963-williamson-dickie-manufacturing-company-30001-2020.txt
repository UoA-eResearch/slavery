****** Modern Slavery Statement ******
***** Our Guiding Principles *****
At VF, our Guiding Principles influence everything we do. Modeling these
behaviors and attitudes in a holistic manner helps our associates and business
partners navigate even the most complex situations. We believe in partnering
with others who share our values and who understand the importance of always
conducting business ethically. VF has made worker wellbeing a priority of our
Made_for_Change strategy, and has set a goal to measurably improve the lives of
2 million workers and others within their communities by 2030. As part of our
focus on workers, we are committed to taking steps to address modern slavery.
This statement discusses the activities of VF Corporation and its current
consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, âVF,â âwe,â âusâ and
âourâ) during 2018 to address forced labor, human trafficking and slavery
and servitude (collectively, âmodern slaveryâ) in our business and supply
chains. This statement is published pursuant to both the California
Transparency in Supply Chains Act and the UK Modern Slavery Act and relates to
the fiscal year from April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019.
Consistent with our values, we have signed numerous public pledges
demonstrating our firm opposition to the use of forced labor. We are
signatories to the American Apparel and Footwear Industry (AAFA) and the Fair
Labor Associationâs (FLA) Apparel and Footwear Industry Commitment to
Responsible Recruitment. As such, we commit to work with our global supply
chain partners to create conditions so that no worker pays for his or her job;
workers retain control of their travel documents and have full freedom of
movement; and all workers are informed of the basic terms of their employment.
VF has also signed the Mekong Clubâs Business Pledge Against Modern Slavery.
Together with the Mekong Club, VF enhanced the forced labor section of our
Global_Compliance_Principles which outline our expectations for how every
business partner and supplier behaves and treats their workers. This includes
criteria on human rights, ethical practices, health and safety, transparency,
environmental requirements and subcontracting. We conduct routine Factory
Compliance_Audits at every contract supplier facility to confirm their
adherence to these principles.
We also have partnered with NGOs and experts from industry and academia to
create our Responsible Sourcing Program. In addition, we have collaborated with
Shift, a leading center of expertise on the UN Guiding Principles on Business
and Human Rights to map our salient issues. VF also partnered with Verisk
Maplecroft to further understand the full spectrum of political, economic,
human rights and environmental issues within our supply chain. Furthermore, as
we expand our supply chain into new countries, we work with local governments
to establish rules and standards that enable productive, safe and respectful
working environments. For example, in 2017 VF engaged the Cambodian, Kenyan and
Ethiopian governments in human rights discussions.
***** Our Business and Supply Chains *****
VF is a global leader in branded lifestyle apparel, footwear and accessories.
In 2018 we owned and operated 22 manufacturing facilities, in the United
States, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. In the fiscal year ending
March 31, 2019, 21% of our units were manufactured in VF-owned facilities.
In addition to VF-owned and operated factories, we sourced products from
approximately 1,200 independent contractor facilities in more than 60
countries. In the year ending March 31, 2019, 79% of our products were obtained
from independent contractors. These contractors are engaged through VF sourcing
hubs in Hong Kong (with satellite offices across Asia), Switzerland, and
Panama. Among other things, the hubs are responsible for supplier oversight,
sustainability within the supply chain and responsible sourcing.
On May 23, 2019, VF completed its previously announced separation of its
Jeanswear organization into an independent, publicly traded company. The new
company, named Kontoor Brands, Inc., includes the WranglerÂ®, LeeÂ® and Rock &
RepublicÂ® brands, and the VF Outletâ¢ business. This statement excludes the
Kontoor Brands business.

***** Policies, Principles and Guidelines *****
Code of Business Conduct
All VF associates must comply with our Code_of_Business_Conduct, which
explicitly forbids the use of forced or involuntary labor in any of our
locations or in the operations of facilities that produce goods for us.
Violation of our Code of Business Conduct by an associate can result in
disciplinary action, including termination of employment.
Global Compliance Principles
Our contracted supplier factories are expected to comply with VFâs Terms_of
Engagement. Contracted factories are also bound by our Global_Compliance
Principles. Our Global Compliance Principles are informed by the International
Labour Organization, the Fair Labor Association, and other international
standards on human rights. Consistent with internationally recognized labor
standards, the Global Compliance Principles specify minimum working conditions
for employees of our suppliers. The Global Compliance Principles expressly
provide that contracted factories may not use involuntary or forced labor,
including indentured labor, bonded labor or any other form of forced labor,
including human trafficking. Among other things, the Global Compliance
Principles also address child labor, wages and benefits and working hours.
Failure to comply with the Global Compliance Principles may result in
termination of the relationship between VF and the contracted factory.
Contracted factories are prohibited from engaging subcontractors to produce VF
products without the written permission of VF, and only after the subcontractor
has agreed to comply with the Global Compliance Principles.
Vendor Terms of Engagement
We hold our contracted factories to the same standards of social and
environmental responsibilities found in our own facilities. As such, we
evaluate potential contracted factories against our standards and require them
to agree to VFâs Terms_of_Engagement, prior to entering our supply chain. Our
Terms of Engagement require contracted factories to conduct business in full
compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, which include those
relating to modern slavery, and comply with the terms of VF's_Global_Compliance
Principles, which are further discussed below. A contracted factoryâs breach
of the Terms of Engagement can result in VF taking corrective action, including
termination as an approved contracted factory.
Facility Guidelines
The Global Compliance Principles are supported by Facility_Guidelines, which
provide more detailed compliance requirements relating to each of the
Principles, including the Principle prohibiting forced labor. The Facility
Guidelines are updated annually.
The Facility Guidelines prohibit recruitment or employment practices that
result in forced labor. In addition, among other things, the Facility
Guidelines require a written policy regarding migrant labor, if it is used by
the contracted factory, and contain general requirements regarding contracts of
employment for migrant laborers. The Facility Guidelines prohibit deducting
recruitment fees and expenses from wages, access to or control over bank
accounts and withholding identity documents. The Facility Guidelines also
require freedom of movement and access to grievance mechanisms.
Cotton Fiber Sourcing
Due to concerns associated with established forced labor, child labor and
militant groups for cotton farming in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Syria, we
have banned the use of cotton from these countries. Our Cotton_Fiber_Sourcing
Policy details mandatory steps that all VF suppliers must take to track the
origin and flow of material through each stage of their cotton supply chains.
North Korean Labor Prohibition
The United States has adopted measures that create a presumption that all goods
produced in whole or in part by North Korean labor, wherever located
geographically, involve the use of forced labor and may not be imported into
the United States. Authorized facilities and their supply chains for VF goods
may not use North Korean labor located anywhere, including outside of North
Korea, unless it can be demonstrated by the facility to our satisfaction in
advance that the North Koreans employed in making the goods were not subject to
conditions of forced labor.
***** Factory Audits *****
Factory Compliance Audits
Before conducting business with VF, each contracted factory must undergo a
Factory_Compliance_Audit. Our on-site audit process includes scheduled and
unannounced audits by our trained factory compliance auditors and third-party
auditors. We use our own trained factory compliance auditors as well as
accredited third-party auditors to assess vendor compliance with our Terms of
Engagement and Global Compliance Principles. We inspect for evidence of health
and safety concerns, wage and social compliance, forced labor and human
trafficking, child labor issues, harassment-free workplace policies, and
environmental issues. Our audit procedures also apply to nominated Tier-
2 factories, cutting facilities, sewing plants, screen printers, embroiderers,
laundries, licensee factories and key fabric mills. VFâs Facility Guidelines
provide direction for our contracted factories to assist in compliance with our
audit program.
To receive an âacceptedâ rating, a factory must not have any serious
health, safety or labor issues in its facility. A factory receiving an accepted
rating is audited annually. A factory receiving a âdevelopmentalâ rating
may still produce our products, but a follow-up audit will be scheduled after
six months and the factory is expected to remediate issues noted in the
corrective action plan. A factory with persistent safety, health or labor
issues that fails to remediate issues in an acceptable manner will be rejected
as our supplier and unauthorized to supply product for VF. VF has piloted the
Apprise Victim Identification Mobile App developed by the United Nations
University for Computing and Society. Apprise is being tested in our audits to
help front-line responders screen potential victims of exploitation.
Under our Global Compliance Principles, contracted factories must allow VF
representatives full access to production facilities, employee records and
employees for confidential interviews in connection with monitoring visits.
Contracted factories that produce goods for the U.S. collegiate market also may
be subject to unannounced audits by the Fair Labor Association, a collaborative
effort of universities, civil society organizations and socially responsible
companies dedicated to protecting workersâ rights around the world.
Audit Results and Response
In calendar year 2018, approximately 2,368 audits were conducted globally.
Among other things, the audits included an assessment of compliance with our
labor standards. Of those, 187 factories were rejected for failing to meet one
or more of our standards. In some parts of the world, supplier factories may
face unique challenges in conforming to our Global Compliance Principles,
although they try very hard. In these cases, we work to help those factories
understand their deficiencies and how to resolve the issues that exist. Our
Sustainable Operations Team members serve as coaches to help factory management
understand how they can make improvements to meet VFâs compliance
requirements.
VF-Owned and Operated Factory Certifications
All VF-owned and operated factories also undergo independent certification by
Worldwide_Responsible_Accredited_Production (âWRAPâ). WRAP is an
independent, objective, non-profit team of global social compliance experts
dedicated to promoting safe, lawful, humane and ethical manufacturing around
the world through certification and education.
***** Training *****
VF associates are required to complete online and facilitator-led training on
our Code of Business Conduct during their first 30 days and sign an agreement
to abide by its principles, including those related to modern slavery. For our
associates and management who have direct responsibility for monitoring,
auditing and enforcing our Global Compliance Principles, we provide additional
training conducted by our staff or a third party. Training includes topics such
as identifying child labor, involuntary or forced labor and preventing human
trafficking.
In addition, our Sustainable Operations Team assists factory management at VF-
owned and contracted factories in understanding how they can make improvements
to meet our modern slavery compliance requirements.
***** Grievance Mechanism and Ethics Helpline *****
VF is committed to fostering dialogue and communication through multiple
channels, including our Open Door Policy and our Ethics Helpline. Labor issues
can be reported through the VF Ethics Helpline, which includes multiple
channels for raising concerns. The Helpline is a free, confidential way for
anyone to seek guidance, ask a question or raise a concern. It is available 24
hours a day/seven days a week in every country where VF has associates.
Reporters can contact the Helpline in over 100 languages, and anonymous
reporting is available where allowed by law. Each report is reviewed by a
member of our Ethics and Compliance team and assigned to an appropriate
investigator. To contact the helpline, call 1-866-492-3370 or visit
ethics.vfc.com.
VFâs Ethics Helpline and other grievance mechanisms are available to the
entire supply chain, including workers in the second or third tier of the
supply chain. VF prohibits suppliers from taking retaliatory action against
workers using these mechanisms. VF also encourages suppliers to establish their
own grievance mechanisms.
This statement covers April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019 and has been approved by
the Board of VF Corporation.
