***** Supply Chain Transparency *****
2019 Statement on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking
Introduction
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, and the UK Modern
Slavery Act of 2015 require certain manufacturers and retailers of goods to be
transparent about efforts undertaken to identify and eradicate modern slavery
and human trafficking from their supply chains or their own operations.
 
Gildan is committed to maintaining high ethical standards in all of our
operations and business practices worldwide, and as such, does not tolerate
modern slavery or human trafficking in any form. We adhere to our own Code of
Conduct, which is based on the International Labour Organization (ILO)
Conventions, as well as to the codes set forth by the Fair Labor Association
(“FLA”) and the Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (“WRAP”), all of
which include strict provisions with regards to forced and child labour such as
human trafficking and slavery.
 
This commitment is further demonstrated by the fact that, in 2007, Gildan
became the first vertically-integrated apparel manufacturer to have its social
compliance program accredited by the FLA and since 2013, Gildan has been
included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). The annual DJSI review
is based on a thorough analysis which covers, among others, issues such as
supply chain standards, human rights and labour practices.
 
In October of 2018, Gildan joined the Industry Commitment to Responsible
Recruitment developed in conjunction with the American Apparel & Footwear
Association and the FLA. The commitment is a proactive industry effort to
address potential forced labour risks for migrant workers in the global supply
chain. Signatories of the Commitment must ensure that no worker be required to
pay for their job, workers must retain control of their travel documents and
workers must have full freedom of movement. In addition, all workers must be
informed of the basic terms of their employment before leaving their home
country.
 
Our business and supply chain
Gildan owns and operates vertically-integrated, large-scale manufacturing
facilities which are primarily located in Central America, the Caribbean Basin,
North America, and Bangladesh. These facilities are strategically located to
efficiently service the quick replenishment needs of Gildan’s customers. With
over 50,000 direct employees worldwide, Gildan operates with a strong
commitment to industry-leading labour and environmental practices throughout
its supply chain in accordance with its comprehensive corporate social
responsibility program embedded in the Company’s long-term business strategy.
 
The vast majority of our products are manufactured in our own facilities. While
we produce the majority of the products we sell internally, we also have
sourcing capabilities which represent less than 10% of our total production in
terms of revenues.
 
Our policies addressing slavery and human trafficking
Our comprehensive group-wide Code_of_Ethics, which is applicable to all Gildan
directors, officers and employees worldwide, sets out the Company’s standards
of integrity and expectations for ethical behaviour. It serves as an
affirmation of our strong commitment to fair labour practices in the workplace,
as a framework in guiding the Company’s operations and business practices
throughout the world, and as a guide to help employees make decisions that are
consistent with Gildan’s core values and principles.
 
In addition to our Code of Ethics, Gildan has also implemented a Code_of
Conduct, which affirms our position on a wide range of labour practices and
directs activities at each of our operating locations. Our Code of Conduct,
which is based on the ILO Conventions, encompasses elements set forth by the
FLA, as well as best practices commonly agreed upon in the area of corporate
social responsibility. Our Code of Conduct explicitly states that “Gildan and
its business partners will not use forced labour, including prison labour,
indentured labour, bonded labour or any other form of forced labour.”
 
Furthermore, the labour standards set forth in our Code of Conduct are
complemented by specific procedures and practical requirements explained
in Gildan’s Social and Sustainable Compliance Guidebook, which is provided to
all our manufacturing contractors. This Guidebook classifies forced labour and
human trafficking as zero tolerance issue.
 
Finally, our whistleblowing policy encourages our employees to report any real
or suspected misconduct, which extends to concerns relating to human rights
violations like slavery and human trafficking. All reports received through the
various reporting channels available to our employees – including our Ethics
and_Compliance_Hotline – are fully investigated and appropriate remedial
actions are taken.
 
Verification of product supply chain to evaluate and address risks of human
trafficking and slavery
Gildan is committed to sourcing products and raw materials from suppliers that
engage in responsible practices. The Company identifies and assesses potential
risks in its supply chain by conducting a due diligence review of potential
business partners prior to entering into sourcing or major supply agreements.
Such evaluation starts by a consideration of inherent and potential risks based
on geographical location and industry type and includes, when appropriate,
questionnaires and local verifications. In some instances, Gildan will mandate
a third-party audit service provider to conduct these verifications on its
behalf.
 
Our due diligence helps guide our business decisions and ensures that all
facilities manufacturing our products comply with our Code of Conduct, as well
as local and international laws. Where there is a concern of potential human
rights infringements such as slavery or human trafficking, Gildan will not
engage in a particular business relationship. As an example, Gildan has
undertaken to ban cotton originating from Uzbekistan due to concerns over
forced labour in the Uzbek cotton industry, or to avoid the use in our products
of certain minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo and
adjoining countries (the so-called “conflict minerals”).

2018_csr_report_final_video_ky9C3wv.pdf (page 45).
 
Audits to evaluate supplier compliance with Company standards for human
trafficking and slavery in supply chains
To ensure compliance with our Code of Conduct, we perform independent internal
and third party working conditions audits at each of our owned and contracted
facilities that manufacture our products. The majority of the audits are
conducted by our trained internal auditors, while third party auditors are
employed in some instances. Some of our manufacturing contractors have been
participating in the ILO Better Work Programme. Gildan’s manufacturing
facilities, as well as its contractors, are also independently audited by the
FLA, WRAP and some of our customers. All Gildan-owned and third-party
contractor facilities are subject to a complete internal audit based on a risk
assessment that evaluates country risk, order volume, the facility’s rating and
previous audit performance.
 
Gildan’s Code of Conduct is the foundation for all audits conducted at our
manufacturing contractors’ facilities. Assessments are also based on the
standards found in Gildan’s Social and Sustainable Compliance Guidebook.
 
For more information on our auditing practices, please visit: https://
www.genuineresponsibility.com/media/uploads/reports/
2018_csr_report_final_video_ky9C3wv.pdf (page 46).
 
Certification that materials used in production comply with slavery and human
trafficking laws
To ensure that Gildan’s manufacturing contractors and major suppliers respect
and adhere to Gildan’s commitment against slavery and human trafficking, we
require them to undertake in writing that they will adhere to Gildan’s Code of
Conduct, as well as all applicable laws. Such written undertaking is included
in the contracts signed by the manufacturing contractors and major suppliers,
or as part of their annual certification process (when applicable).
 
In addition, in cases where applicable, we also require manufacturing
contractors or suppliers to provide written undertakings of compliance with our
ban on Uzbek cotton or “conflict_minerals”.
 
Internal accountability and procedures for employees or contractors failing to
meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking
Non-compliance with Gildan’s Code of Conduct on slavery and human trafficking
is taken very seriously by Gildan. If such non-compliance occurs, we take
remedial action to contain, address and resolve the situation within the
shortest possible delays. Moreover, such non-compliance will lead to
termination of employment at Gildan and/or termination of a commercial
agreement with Gildan.
 
For more information about our internal accountability mechanisms, please
visit: https://www.genuineresponsibility.com/media/uploads/reports/
2018_csr_report_final_video_ky9C3wv.pdf (page 43).
 
Training on human trafficking and slavery
Gildan requires all of its employees to read, understand and certify their
compliance with our Code of Ethics upon hire. All employees participated in an
interactive on-line course on our Code of Ethics during 2016, and an
interactive on-line course on our Code of Conduct during 2017. We also offer
regular specific training to our internal monitoring teams who work closely
with our management teams and our contractors, to ensure they are knowledgeable
on our requirements and understand the issues related to social compliance and
human rights. In 2018, more than 29,000 hours of training on our Code of
Conduct were provided to our manufacturing employees. We also provide training
directly to our major contractors and suppliers.
 
Conclusion
Our various policies and practices comprised in our CSR social compliance
program are fundamental parts of our efforts to ensure that slavery and human
trafficking are not taking place in our supply chain and our operations. We
understand that the risk associated with slavery and human trafficking is not
static, and we will continue our approach to mitigating this risk in the years
ahead. These efforts, as well as this disclosure, are reviewed by our Board of
Directors and updated annually.
