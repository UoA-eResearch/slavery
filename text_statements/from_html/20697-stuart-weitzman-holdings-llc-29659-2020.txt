****** California Transparency in Supply Chains Act ******
 
Statement for the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act(SB 657)
Coach Services, Inc (the "Company" or "we") is committed to legal compliance
and ethical business practices in all of our operations worldwide. We choose
suppliers and contractors who we believe share that commitment.
We take the risks of slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain very
seriously. Like many companies manufacturing or selling products in California,
we are required to comply with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act
of 2010 (California Senate Bill 657) beginning in 2012.  That law was designed
to increase the amount of information available to consumers about the efforts
of manufacturers and retailers to eliminate the risk of modern day slavery,
forced labor, human trafficking and similar human rights violations ("slavery
and human trafficking") from their supply chain. Accordingly, below are some
examples of how we are working to eliminate that risk from our supply chain.
1.  RISK ASSESSMENT. The Company internally assesses the risk of slavery and
human trafficking with respect to the supply chain for all of its products. To
judge which of its sourcing countries presents the highest risk levels, the
Company utilizes several resources, including the U.S. State Department’s
annual Trafficking in Persons Report’s country rankings, the United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime’s Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, the
Director-General of the International Labour Organization’s reports on forced
labor, and the U.S. Department of Labor’s List of Goods Produced by Child Labor
or Forced Labor.  The Company continuously assesses its risk as these resources
are updated and as new, credible resources become available.
 
2.  AUDITS. The Company conducts audits of its direct suppliers to evaluate
compliance with the Company’s Standards_for_Contractors_and_Suppliers, which
include standards for slavery and human trafficking in the supply chain.To
determine factory selection and timing for audits we look at several criteria,
including factory location (country), size, workforce composition and past
compliance performance, if available, to determine facility risk and audit
priority.In addition to our internal staff, we retain a number of recognized,
unaffiliated third party workplace compliance audit firms to conduct both
announced and unannounced factory audits on our behalf.
The Company utilizes a scorecard system to assign risk levels to suppliers
objectively based on audit results. The scorecard concept is a data-driven
process, with the underlying premises that not all violations should be treated
equally and that some findings are more serious and not as easily corrected as
others.  By comparing audit results, the scorecard system allows the Company to
evaluate and determine where monitoring is needed most.  Over time, audit
scores reflect the compliance status of a factory, making it a useful tool for
internal production divisions to benchmark their factories, vendors and agents
when making sourcing decisions. The Company also supports ongoing supplier
improvements through training and technical assistance.
 
3.  SUPPLIER CERTIFICATION. The Company requires that all of its suppliers
comply with applicable laws within their country of business regarding slavery
and human trafficking.  Since 1996, the Company has required all of its
contractors and suppliers to adhere to its Standards for Contractors and
Suppliers, which, among other things, prohibits child labor and any form of
forced, compulsory, bonded, indentured or prison labor and requires compliance
with applicable laws and regulations regarding health and safety in working
conditions. In addition, as part of the Company’s purchase order and commercial
invoice processes, factories are required to certify compliance with the
Company’s Standards concerning elimination of the risk of slavery and human
trafficking practices in their supply chains.
 
4.  ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES. All Company employees and agents
with production, sourcing or quality control responsibilities, as well as
internal buying offices and trading companies doing business with the Company,
are provided with copies of the Company’s compliance program policies and
procedures related to the enforcement of its Standards for Contractors and
Suppliers. These policies and procedures, which are outlined in our Corporate
Compliance Operations Manual, include issuance of zero tolerance notifications
for violations of the Company’s prohibition on use of child or forced labor and
implementation of corrective action plans. In the case of non-compliance, the
Company examines the specific situation and develops an appropriate strategy
for resolution.
 
5.  TRAINING. The Company conducts internal training of its managers and
employees with direct responsibility for supply chain management that
specifically raises awareness of slavery and human trafficking and focuses on
mitigating the risks within our supply chain. In addition, the Company’s
internal corporate compliance employees, as well as third party monitors
contracted to audit facilities in the Company’s supply chain, have participated
in training jointly developed and delivered by the United Nations Global
Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking ("UN.GIFT") and the International Labor
Organization ("ILO"). That training helps internal and external monitors to
thoroughly monitor the risk of forced labor in the Company’s supply chain and
to develop and deliver training programs for agents, vendors and other supply
chain partners on the issue, including how to identify and mitigate forced
labor and trafficking risks in their recruitment processes.
The Company also conducts training programs targeted to suppliers on topics
that support awareness of the Company’s Standards for Contractors and Suppliers
to ensure the appropriate participants in supply chain management are
knowledgeable concerning the Company’s requirements for suppliers.  The Company
encourages its agents, vendors and suppliers to participate in seminars and
training programs on social compliance issues (including the issues of slavery
and human trafficking) to further raise awareness of the issues and mitigate
the risks within the Company’s supply chain.
