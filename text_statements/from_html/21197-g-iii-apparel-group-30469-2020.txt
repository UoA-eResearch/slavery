CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT
In 2010, a law was passed in the state of California requiring companies to
disclose what they are doing to address human trafficking in their supply
chains. The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act seeks to âeducate
consumers on how to purchase goods produced by companies that responsibly
manage their supply chains â¦ to improve the lives of victims of slavery and
human trafficking.â
G-III Apparel Group, Inc. (âG-IIIâ) strives to ensure that its products are
produced in a legally and socially responsible manner and to prevent complicity
in abusive employment practices such as human trafficking and slavery. The
items outlined below explain what G-III is doing to address each of the five
pillars of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act.
   1. Verification of Supply Chain â We have developed a vendor compliance
      program that requires vendors to comply with applicable employment and
      human rights laws, as well as adhere to G-IIIâs own standards intended
      to eliminate abusive employment practices, including forced labor, human
      trafficking and slave labor. Vendors must also certify their compliance
      with such laws and G-IIIâs own standards. We verify compliance using
      internal and third party auditors.
   2. Supplier Audits â We conduct audits of supplierâs facilities using
      independent third-parties to determine whether these facilities are in
      compliance with laws and our standards. We also use internal personnel to
      periodically verify compliance. Verification of the product supply chain
      to determine whether facilities are in compliance with laws and our
      standards include both announced and unannounced audits of vendor
      facilities.
   3. Supplier Certifications â We require our direct suppliers to certify
      that they comply with all appropriate laws and our standards prior to the
      placement of an order by us. This certification of compliance includes
      materials incorporated by our direct suppliers in products they produce
      for us.
   4. Standards â We maintain internal accountability standards and
      procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company
      standards. Failure of our employees to abide by G-IIIâs Code of
      Business Conduct can result in corrective action up to and including
      termination of employment. Failure of vendors to abide by our standards
      can result in corrective action plans and other disciplinary measures for
      vendors who are found to violate applicable laws or our standards up to
      and including termination of our business relationship with the vendor.
   5. Employee Training â G-III conducts internal training with respect to
      our vendor compliance program and our standards to ensure that personnel
      involved in supply chain management are made aware of how to identify
      potentially abusive situations.
