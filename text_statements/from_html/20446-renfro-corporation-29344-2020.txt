****** California Transparency in Supply Chains Act ******
***** RENFRO CORPORATION
CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT OF 2010
CORPORATE DISCLOSURE *****
Renfro Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Renfro”) is dedicated to
conducting business in a lawful and ethical manner. Renfro supports the right
of all individuals to be free from slavery and human trafficking. Renfro’s Code
of Corporate Responsibility (“Code”) prohibits the use of forced and child
labor by Renfro, its suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venturers. All of
Renfro’s suppliers and subcontractors must sign an agreement to abide by the
terms of its Code, and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
Renfro endeavors to verify that its suppliers, subcontractors, and joint
venturers comply with its Code. Renfro checks for signs of human trafficking
and slavery in all factories that manufacture for Renfro during routine factory
visits and audits conducted by Renfro’s own trained auditors or independent
auditors, which may occur daily, weekly or monthly, and may be announced or
unannounced. In addition, Renfro conducts specific human trafficking, slavery,
and child labor inspections at each of the factories in its supply chain at
least once per year. Renfro’s auditors have been trained in the signs of human
trafficking and in best practices for reporting suspicions. If suspected abuse
is reported, Renfro sends a third party auditing firm to evaluate the
suspicion.
Further, Renfro requires all direct suppliers of Renfro products to certify
that all materials incorporated into Renfro’s products and packaging comply
with U.S. law prohibiting slavery and human trafficking, and that slavery and
human trafficking were not used in the process of making any of Renfro’s
products. Renfro also highly encourages its suppliers to participate in
approved compliance monitoring programs, such as WRAP (Worldwide Responsible
Apparel Producers) and SA 8000, although these programs do not replace Renfro’s
own auditing.
Should a supplier or subcontractor fail to meet Renfro’s standards, or
otherwise comply with applicable laws and regulations, the supplier or
subcontractor will no longer be permitted to supply products to Renfro. Renfro
believes that these and other strategies will help prevent human trafficking
and slavery within its supply chain.
