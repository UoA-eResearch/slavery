****** 2018 Statement on California Transparency Act and U.K. Modern Slavery
Act ******

Marc Jacobs International, LLC (together with its affiliated companies, "MJI"
or "we") is a multinational fashion company with retail and supply chain
operations across the globe.

We are committed to conducting business in a lawful, ethical, and responsible
manner. We expect our vendors to respect and adhere to the same business
philosophy in the operation of their businesses.

In compliance with the requirements of the California Transparency in Supply
Chains Act (SB 657) and the U.K. Modern Slavery Act of 2015, this document
describes the steps MJI takes to ensure slavery and human trafficking are not
occurring in our supply chain and business operations. MJI considers any form
of slavery or human trafficking to be abhorrent, and we are committed to acting
with integrity and appropriate transparency in our business dealings, including
by developing effective controls to safeguard against the risk of slavery or
human trafficking. As part of this ongoing commitment, we take the following
steps to prevent slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain and business
operations:

â¢ Policies: MJI is committed to act with integrity in all of our business
dealings, promote ethical conduct, enhance compliance with applicable laws, and
provide guidance with respect to business conduct. To such ends, MJI has
adopted a human rights policy in the MJI Employee Handbook and the MJI Supplier
(i.e., Vendor) Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. In addition, MJI's parent
company, LVMH MoÃ«t Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE ("LVMH"), has adopted a code of
conduct. These polices apply to all MJI employees and vendors and, among other
issues, address the prohibition of slavery and human trafficking. These
policies also describe our commitments in other ethics and compliance areas,
including the elimination of employment discrimination and harassment,
abolition of child labor, promotion of health and safety for employees and
vendors, fighting corruption, and preserving and respecting the environment.

â¢ Verification: MJI engages in multiple internal and external actions to
identify, assess, and manage the risk of slavery and human trafficking in our
supply chain and business operations. Our verification procedures include risk
assessment of vendors based on their geography, industry, and information
gathered from outside organizations such as industry groups.

â¢ Audits: MJI audits certain finished goods and materials vendors for
compliance with MJI's Supplier Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. For
auditing purposes, MJI engages external third-party compliance firms to perform
announced or semi-announced assessments of vendors. Following an audit or re-
audit, vendors are required to address any non-compliance deficiencies
identified. A vendor's failure to address and correct such deficiencies will
result in a re-evaluation of MJI's business relationship with the vendor and
possible disciplinary action of up to termination of the vendor's business
relationship with MJI.

â¢ Certifications: MJI requests that its finished goods and materials vendors
certify their compliance with MJI's Supplier Code of Business Conduct and
Ethics. We also request that these vendors complete a questionnaire so that we
can further gauge the vendor's risk for slavery or human trafficking abuses. A
vendor's failure to adhere to these requirements may result in disciplinary
action of up to termination of the vendor's business relationship with MJI.

â¢ Internal accountability: MJI maintains internal accountability standards
for its employees. As mentioned, all MJI employees must follow the MJI Employee
Handbook and LVMH Code of Conduct. We also have internal and external reporting
mechanisms for MJI employees to report on possible compliance and ethics
violations, including slavery and human trafficking, such as access to an
anonymous reporting hotline.

â¢ Training: MJI provides training to its employees with direct responsibility
for supply chain management and to Tier 1 (finished goods) and Tier 2
(materials) vendors. The training is focused on helping MJI employees and
vendors prevent, detect, and respond to compliance issues, including slavery
and human trafficking violations. In this regard, the training covers
evaluating risk based on geography and industry, common indicia for violations,
and seeking help when potential violations are detected.

MJI will continue to review and, where possible, improve our efforts to prevent
slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain and business operations.
