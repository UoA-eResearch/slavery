****** Modern Slavery Act Statement ******
 Alfred Dunhill Limited
Modern Slavery Act Statement â FY18

This statement has been published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act
2015 (the "Act"). It sets out the steps that Alfred Dunhill Limited has taken
during the financial year ending 31 March 2018 to prevent modern slavery and
human trafficking in its supply chains or within any part of the business.

Alfred Dunhill Limited has a zero tolerance approach to modern slavery and we
are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business
dealings. We recognise that no supply chain is without risk of modern slavery
and it is our responsibility to ensure we understand these risks and work
together with our suppliers to mitigate them.

Our Business
Alfred Dunhill Limited engages with carefully selected suppliers to manufacture
its products and/or provide relevant services to the company. We sell our
branded products either through Alfred Dunhill Limited's own-managed points of
sales or through authorised wholesale accounts.

As part of the Richemont Group ("Group"), Alfred Dunhill Limited adheres to
Group policies, procedures and standards relating to the management of its
supply chain and its general business conduct. Details of the Group's business
governance and corporate social responsibility policies can be found at https:/
/www.richemont.com/corporate-social-responsibility/governanceethics/
policies.html

Our Supply Chain Relationships
Alfred Dunhill Limited strives to maintain good relationships with suppliers
based on the principles of fair, open, honest and ethical dealings at all times
whilst ensuring the continued quality of its branded products.

Alfred Dunhill Limited has an extensive range of global supplier relationships.
However, from 1 September 2017, all inventory purchasing and distribution flows
were transferred from Alfred Dunhill Limited to a Richemont Group Company based
in Switzerland to improve operational efficiencies within the brand. We now
indirectly source finished products, through this Richemont Group Company.

Our Policies and Processes
When taking on new product suppliers, Alfred Dunhill Limited undertakes due
diligence that is carried out by the supply chain and procurement teams within
the business. As part of this process, suppliers are required to sign our terms
and conditions of purchase and other documents including the Richemont Group
Supplier Code of Conduct ("Code of Conduct").

The Code of Conduct covers the following areas:

- No forced employment â not using forced labour and not using employment
where terms are not voluntary;
- Healthy and safe working conditions â providing a healthy and safe working
environment in accordance with applicable laws and regulations;
- Wages and working hours â complying with local legislation on minimum
wages, working hours and employee benefits;
- Freedom of association â allowing workers to associate with lawful and
peaceful workers' associations;
- No discrimination â net subjecting people to discrimination based on
factors including ethnicity, age, religion and sexual orientation, amongst
others;
- No child labour â net employing people under the age of 15 or younger than
the age for completing compulsory education;
- No use of corporal punishment â and not subjecting people to harassment,
violence or intimidation;
- Responsible environmental management â fully complying with local
legislation, industry regulations and the Richemont Environmental Code of
Conduct;
- Grievance Procedure and Whistleblowing â allowing workers to report actual
or suspected misconduct without fear of reprisal.

A full copy of the Code of Conduct, which was updated in 2017, is available at:
https://www.richemont.com/images/csr/2017/supplier_code_of_conduct_2017.pdf.

Alfred Dunhill Limited also works in partnership with an accredited compliancy
verification company in order to carry out audits of our suppliers. Our
suppliers are audited at least every 3 years. The audits cover manufacturing
sites including sub-contractors. We audit suppliers according to the SEDEX
Member Ethical Trade audit formats which assess the suppliers on Health &
Safety, Labour Standards, Environment and Business Ethics in line with our
Supplier Code of Conduct.

In the event that Alfred Dunhill Limited's due diligence processes, including
audits, highlight a risk of slavery and/or human trafficking, or any other non-
compliance with the Code of Conduct, we will assess such non-compliance on a
case by case basis and take appropriate remedial action.

We endeavour to trade only with those suppliers who comply with the Code of
Conduct or those who are taking verifiable steps towards compliance.
Arrangements with suppliers in material or persistent breach will be
terminated.

We also recognise the risk that modern slavery can exist within our non-product
supply chain.

During the financial year ending 31 March 2018, Alfred Dunhill continues to
source directly from non-product suppliers. We request these suppliers to
adhere to our Group's Code of Conduct and we continue to assess those suppliers
who have not returned a signed confirmation of compliance, in order to ensure
they have sufficient processes and policies in place to satisfy us that they
are operating to the highest standards.

Our Training
The Group and Alfred Dunhill Limited continue to take steps to increase
employee awareness and engagement regarding slavery and human trafficking
issues. Richemont's Corporate Social Responsibility Guidelines ("Guidelines"),
which defines the standards the Group expects its managers, employees and
suppliers to uphold, specifically articulate the Group's zero-tolerance policy
regarding forced labour.

A copy of the Guidelines can be found at:
https://www.richemont.com/images/csr/2012/
extract_corporate_social_responsbilitiy_guidelines_based_on_jul08_version.pdf

As part of our ongoing commitment, this year we launched a new compliance
module titled 'Avoiding Trafficked Labour'. All relevant employees (current and
new) working for Richemont Group's UK subsidiaries are required to complete
this module and it is accessible via our learning management system. The module
helps to recognize and raise the awareness on human trafficking while also
explaining how to avoid the risks in our supply chains through different case
scenarios.

Our Employees
Alfred Dunhill Limited and the Group have a whistleblowing policy and a hotline
for employees to voice any concerns they may have including concens about any
part of the Alfred Dunhill Limited business.
Alfred Dunhill Limited is committed to maintaining and improving systems and
processes in order to eliminate all forms of forced and compulsory labour
within its supply chain and its business. Alfred Dunhill Limited will continue
to review its policies and processes to ensure the highest standards in its
supply chain, as expected by customers, the companies with which it works and
in accordance with the requirements of its Group.

of these companies have been supplying Alfred Dunhill Limited for more than 10
years. 85% of our suppliers are based in Western Europe

Alfred Dunhill Limited also works in partnership with a compliancy verification
company who is an AAG member of SEDEX. This company utilises auditors with
SociaI Accountability Certification SA8000 accreditation in order to carry out
audits of our suppliers.

We have a rolling auditing plan where our suppliers are audited at least every
3 years. The audits cover manufacturing sites including sub-contractors. We
audit suppliers according to the SMETA 4 Pillar audit which assesses the
suppliers on Health & Safety, Labour Standards, Environment and Business Ethics
in line with our Supplier Code of Conduct.

In the event that Alfred Dunhill Limited's due diligence processes, including

case by case basis and take appropriate remedial action.

We endeavour to trade only with those suppliers who comply with the Code of
Conduct or those who are taking verifiable steps towards compliance.
Arrangements with suppliers in material or persistent breach will be
terminated.

We also recognise the risk that modem slavery can exist within our non-product
supply chain.

During the financial year ending 31 March 2017, we asked all our non-product
suppliers to confirm in writing their compliance with the Act, as well as that
of their sub-contractors. Out of approximately 100 suppliers contacted, over
half have so far returned a signed confirmation of compliance. We will continue
to assess whether those suppliers who have not returned a signed confirmation
of compliance have sufficient processes and policies in place to satisfy us
that they are operating to the highest standards required by us and the Group
and in any event in accordance with the requirements of the Act.

During the next financial year we will assess the risk of our non-product
supply chain to further understand the risk of modem slavery and to take steps
to mitigate this risk where possible.

Standards and Health & Safety non-compliance issues when visiting suppliers.
