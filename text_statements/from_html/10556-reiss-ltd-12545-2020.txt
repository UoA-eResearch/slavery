***** MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT 2016 / 2017 *****
This statement has been published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act
2015. It sets out the steps taken by REISS LIMITED (âREISSâ) during the
financial year ending 31st January 2017 to prevent modern slavery and human
trafficking in its business and supply chains.
Â 
Our_Commitment
REISS is committed to ensuring that its operations and supply chains promote
safe, fair, legal and humane working conditions. This means we expect the
business and our suppliers to abide by local laws, international labour and
human rights standards in all countries in which we or they operate. Our
commitment to the eradication of slavery, servitude, forced labour and human
trafficking (collectively referred to as modern slavery) in the business and
our supply chain is closely aligned with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.Â  We
recognise the reality of these issues for all concerned and we have embraced
measures to identify the risks to our business that modern slavery presents.
This statement provides an overview of our work to implement an effective
governance framework and our enhanced due diligence process which includes a
close review of modern slavery risks and indicative factors in the way we
operate and how we source. We view the content of this statement as part of a
programme that we expect to progressively enhance.
Establishing_a_Governance_Framework
The Reiss ethical compliance and due-diligence programme sets out our
requirements, expectations and guidance for suppliers. It encompasses our
Supplier Manual, Supplier Code of Conduct, Self-Assessment Questionnaire and
Supplier Engagement Terms of Business as well as core production measures,
including purchase order terms, labelling guidelines and inspection processes.
We expect all our suppliers to understand, sign and comply with this programme.
Failure to comply could result in an order being cancelled or goods being
rejected. The programme applies equally to production and sourcing and supports
our ability to meet the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act.
Supplier_Engagement_Terms_of_Business
This year Reiss amended its Standard Supplier Engagement Terms of Business to
include additional obligations on suppliers to comply with the Modern Slavery
Act and assess the risks of this in their own operations and supply chains. All
suppliers were also required to declare all factories and subcontractor units
to support efforts of greater transparency, compliance and capacity building in
our supply chain. We use this information to structure our audit process as
detailed in the Evaluation section below.
Supplier_Code_of_Conduct
Our Supplier Code of Conduct builds on the Ethical Trading Initiative and
International Labour Organisation principles, standards and guidelines. We
refresh our code every two years. The last update was completed in February
2017 to include additional language on child labour, human trafficking, slavery
and anti-corruption, thus ensuring alignment with the intent of the Modern
Slavery Act and align with best practice and stakeholder expectations.
Our Code requires that suppliers and factories grant access to both Reiss and
third party auditors to perform unannounced audits that check compliance with
all core labour rights. It is the responsibility of Reiss suppliers and other
business partners to inform their subcontractors about the Reiss Code of
Conduct. To date, 100% of our active suppliers have received our code of
conduct.
Evaluating_Supplier_Risk_and_Compliance
In 2016, Reiss manufactured products in 15 different territories including
Asia, Europe, and Latin America. All of these countries face their own
geopolitical, cultural and legal differences when implementing our Supplier
Code of Conduct. It is partly for these reasons that the Reiss team also
evaluate and monitor compliance using self-assessments and third party audits.
Supplier_Self-Assessment
Reiss asks suppliers to complete a self-assessment form for each factory and
location that produces Reiss products. The Self-Assessment is an integrated
exercise providing insight into a factoryâs workplace, environmental
protection and health & safety policies in addition to subcontracted processes,
if any.Â 
As part of completing and returning this documentation, suppliers are also
asked to submit a copy of their last social compliance audit. This process
enables us to identify and approve any factories and sub-contractors before an
order is placed, hence contributing to our overall decision making on further
compliance assessments and sourcing adjustments.Â 
Risk_Assessment
In 2016, Reiss conducted a risk assessment of all suppliers and factories to
evaluate which should be prioritised for audit. The prioritisation process work
included country risk insight from public sources such as the World Bank,
United Nations and the Global Slavery Index. This inherent country risk insight
was combined with knowledge of our supply chain including product category,
annual spend and trends, units and level of influence. Our Supplier Code of
Conduct and due diligence programme have been designed to help mitigate these
risks in partnership with our suppliers.
Supplier_Audits
Our new suppliers and factories / sites are all subject to due diligence checks
and, based on higher geographical risks, an ethical audit will be conducted on
behalf of Reiss. Such third party audits are also regularly conducted for
existing suppliers and factories/sites. These audits assess compliance with our
Supplier Code of Conduct and are, amongst other things, intended to identify
any modern slavery practices. If issues are identified, appropriate
investigative and remedial actions are taken. During 2016 / 17, we conducted
ethical audits (semi-announced) in Europe and Asia, covering the majority of
our purchasing volumes for the year. These confirmed that no issues under the
headings related to forced labour were present.
Further_steps_to_prevent_modern_slavery_in_our_supply_chain
Reiss is committed to expand its ethical compliance and due-diligence
programme. Our goal is to increase our visibility in the supply chains where
our products are made and strengthen our relations with suppliers to foster a
culture of collaboration and transparency.
To this end, we are now rolling-out a new on-boarding process, evaluating all
new suppliers before placing an order, but also completing the auditing process
of our current factories globally by the end of 2017. After the audit, we are
accompanying and supporting factories in ensuring Corrective Action Plans are
followed and completed.
Finally, Reiss has initiated the process to become a member of the Ethical
Trade Initiative and join like-minded brands in implementing international
positive and ethical sourcing practices.
