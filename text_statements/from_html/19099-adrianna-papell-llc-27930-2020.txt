Disclosure under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and UK Modern
Slavery Act
 
This Statement relates to our fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (“Fiscal
2016”). This Statement describes the activities of Adrianna Papell LLC and its
subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, the “Company,” “we” or
“our”).   It is the Company’s policy to comply with all applicable laws
relating to its supply chains and the Company has procedures in place to
evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery consistent with the
California Transparency Act and the Modern Slavery Act of 2015.   As part of
periodic and routine audits of our third-party manufacturing contractors,
suppliers and vendors (“Suppliers”) conducted by our agents, we verify
compliance with Company standards against human trafficking and slavery in its
supply chains as set forth in the Company’s Global Social Compliance Guide
(“Compliance Guide”) and Code of Conduct. Adrianna Papell has confirmed with
its Suppliers that materials incorporated into our products comply with
applicable laws against slavery and human trafficking in the countries in which
they are doing business. Our employees and business partners are aware of the
appropriate action to take in the event that a supplier does not meet Company
standards regarding slavery and trafficking, and ongoing educational efforts
are conducted for Company employees and management who have direct
responsibility for supply chain management.
 
Our Business.
The Adrianna Papell Group, is a leading women’s apparel company, founded in New
York in 1979 and celebrates over 37 years of dressing women for all occasions. 
The Company has been focused on a single mission: “to make every woman feel
beautiful”. With an artisanal attention to detail, the Adrianna Papell
collections are best known for an elegance and flair that empowers women of all
ages and silhouettes to feel their very best.  The key to our success is
strategically positioning ourselves as a brand that offers modern fashion at an
affordable prices.  The Adrianna Papell brand has a substantial market share in
the dress business and is distributed to all leading retailers in the United
States and has expanded its business across 27 countries, including the UK,
through various channels and free standing stores globally.  
 
Our Products. 
Our products are manufactured to our specifications. We contract for the
purchase of finished goods principally with independent third-party
manufacturing contractors, whereby the manufacturing contractor is generally
responsible for the entire manufacturing process. Most of our products are
produced by third-party factories in Asia. We have zero tolerance to slavery
and human trafficking. We expect all those in our supply chain and Suppliers
and agents to comply with our values and our Code of Conduct. 
 
Risks of Slavery and Human Trafficking in Supply Chain.
Due to the nature of our workforce and the locations of most of our employees,
we believe that the risks of slavery and human trafficking in our own business
are remote. While there are risks inherent with third-party manufacturing, we
have established the Compliance Guide, Code of Conduct and other procedures to
mitigate the risks of slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains for
our products. Our approach is to focus on our direct Suppliers, since this is
the level of the supply chain where we believe that we have the most influence
and can therefore be the most effective.
 
Commitment to Ethics; Code of Conduct
We are committed to principles of ethical business practice and recognition of
the dignity of others, including responsible labor practices.  Our Compliance
Guide and Code of Conduct are applicable to all of the Company’s Suppliers
(including our third-party manufacturers, suppliers and vendors).   The Code of
Conduct expressly prohibits, among other things, the use of prison or forced
labor or the acquisition of any materials used in any stage of the
manufacturing of our products from a third-party that utilizes prison or forced
labor. In addition, the Code of Conduct provides that our Suppliers must comply
with all laws regulating local wages, work hours and benefits. We communicate
the Compliance Guide and Code of Conduct initially as part of our Supplier
onboarding process and, thereafter, periodically from time to time, including
when there are updates. All of our Suppliers are required to certify compliance
with the Code of Conduct. In the event of a violation of the Code of Conduct,
we reserve the right to either terminate our relationship with the Supplier or
to work with the supplier to implement corrective action to remedy the non-
conformance.
 
Audits and Reviews.
All new Suppliers are approved after they pass our compliance and production
requirements. We require engagement with one of our approved third party
independent social compliance auditing agencies within one (1) year of initial
orders. The production, buying and design team visit Suppliers on a regular
basis to continue to build a strong working partnership. In most
instances,where a deficiency is identified, corrective action is required on a
specified timeline, followed by validation by the Company or its auditor that
such deficiency has been remedied, including, if necessary through a re-audit
of the manufacturer. In the case of a serious violation of the Code of Conduct,
termination of the Company’s relationship with the manufacturer may occur,
particularly where corrective action is either not possible or determined to be
an insufficient remedy.
 
Internal Accountability and Training.
All production employees are required to undergo compliance and ethics
training, including with respect to the Code of Conduct and the Compliance
Guide.

This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015
and constitutes our group’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the
current financial year.
