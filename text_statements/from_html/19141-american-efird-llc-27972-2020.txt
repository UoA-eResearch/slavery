****** California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 ******
Effective January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of
2010 (S.B. 657) requires companies that sell goods in California to make
certain disclosures regarding their efforts to address slavery and human
trafficking. The law is primarily intended to ensure consumers have access to
detailed information about the human rights practices behind the production of
goods that they buy, to assist in buying decisions.
American & Efird LLC holds itself and its suppliers to the highest ethical
standards, and maintains a strong and comprehensive social compliance program
including a Global Code of Conduct enforced at all of its worldwide operations.
American & Efird LCC has zero tolerance for slavery and human trafficking and
in an effort to fulfill the requirements of the California Transparency in
Supply Chains Act provides the following:
American & Efird LLC (“A&E”), strongly support[s] the aims of the California
Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (S.B 657) and expects its associates,
contractors, suppliers and business partners to comply with all applicable
legal requirements regarding human rights and labor practices.
The United Nations Geneva Convention (1926), defines slavery as “the status or
condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right
of ownership are exercised. The slave trade includes all acts involved in the
capture, acquisition or disposal of a person with intent to reduce him to
slavery; all acts involved in the acquisition of a slave with a view to selling
or exchanging him; all acts of disposal by sale or exchange of a slave acquired
with a view to being sold or exchanged, and, in general, every act of trade or
transport in slaves.”
The United Nations in the 2000 Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, defines human
trafficking as “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt
of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion,
of abduction, of fraud, or deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of
vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve
the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of
exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the
prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or
services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of
organs.”
A&E is committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking throughout its
supply chain, which includes its global manufacturing and distribution
facilities. Specifically, A&E’s policies are as follows:
Verification of Supply Chain: A&E relies on its vendors and suppliers, many of
whom it has done business with for decades, to comply with applicable laws in
the jurisdiction in which they operate. For significant suppliers, A&E requires
annual written confirmation to verify that the suppliers are meeting A&E’s
expectations and requirements. Suppliers are also periodically visited by A&E
personnel on a scheduled basis.
Audits: At its larger suppliers’ facilities, A&E conducts periodic scheduled
on-site visits to verify that the suppliers are meeting A&E’s expectations and
requirements, including its commitment to anti-slavery and anti-human
trafficking. Smaller suppliers are also periodically visited by A&E personnel
for scheduled on-site reviews. Our on-site reviews are pre-announced and are
performed by A&E personnel.
Certification from Direct Suppliers: A&E’s direct suppliers are expected and
required to comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the
countries in which they are doing business and provide written certification of
compliance to A&E.
Accountability: A&E maintains the right to investigate and discipline or
terminate business relationships with any associate, contractor or vendor
failing to meet A&E’s expectations or any legal requirements related to slavery
and human trafficking.
Training: Beginning in 2012, A&E will provide company associates and management
who have direct responsibility for supply chain management with periodic
training consisting of dissemination and acknowledgement of our policy against
slavery and human trafficking in out supply chain, particularly with respect to
mitigating risks within the supply chains of products.
