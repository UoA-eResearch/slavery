****** California Transparency in Supply Chain Act of 2010 (SB 657) ******
The California Transparency in Supply Chain Act of 2010 (SB 657) became
effective in the State of California on January 1, 2012. This law was designed
to increase the amount of information made available by companies regarding
their efforts to address the issues of slavery and human trafficking, thereby
allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices about the products
they buy and the companies they choose to support.
Haggar Clothing Co.'s ("Haggar's") efforts include:
    * Haggar engages in verification of its apparel product supply chain to
      evaluate and address risks of slavery and human trafficking. Preliminary
      risk assessments are performed by Haggar on potential suppliers with
      assessment questionnaires, followed by an in-depth assessment conducted
      by a third-party auditing firm. Continuing suppliers are audited by a
      third-party auditing firm on a yearly basis.
       
    * Haggar conducts audits of direct suppliers to evaluate supplier
      compliance with Haggar's standards for human trafficking and slavery. We
      have developed and issued a Code of Conduct to our direct suppliers.
      Direct suppliers are evaluated through audits on their compliance with
      our Code of Conduct. Our audits are unannounced audits performed by a
      third-party auditing firm. Following audits, suppliers are required to
      produce a corrective action plan to outline how the supplier will resolve
      any issues uncovered in the audits. Haggar has zero tolerance for human
      trafficking or slavery.
       
    * Haggar's purchase order agreements require all direct suppliers to comply
      with our Code of Conduct as well as the applicable laws regarding slavery
      and human trafficking of the country in which the suppliers are doing
      business. Haggar also requires its direct suppliers to certify that
      materials incorporated into the products Haggar purchases comply with the
      laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country in which they
      are doing business.
       
    * Haggar maintains and enforces internal accountability standards and
      procedures for employees and contractors regarding company standards that
      address slavery and human trafficking. In the case of non-compliance,
      Haggar reserves the right to examine the specific situation and develop a
      best possible strategy for resolution. If cases of non-compliance are not
      resolved within a timely manner, Haggar may terminate the business
      relationship.
       
    * Haggar conducts internal training on Haggar's Code of Conduct to ensure
      the necessary participants in the supply chain management team are
      knowledgeable and aware of the issues and concerns surrounding, and
      mitigating risks to, the supply chain, including risks of human
      trafficking and slavery. Haggar also encourages employees involved in the
      supply chain to participate in external training programs and seminars on
      social compliance issues, including the issues of human trafficking and
      slavery.
