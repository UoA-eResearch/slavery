California Transparency in Supply Chains
****** California Transparency in Supply Chains ******
Statement Relating to California Transparency in Supply Chains Act
Velcro Companies and its affiliates (collectively, “the Company”) support the
goals of the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act, which requires
companies to disclose the efforts they have made to ensure that their supply
chains are free from slavery and human trafficking. To that end, the Company
seeks to ensure that quality and safety standards are maintained throughout our
supply chain and that workers are treated fairly and in accordance with all
applicable laws. We have undertaken the following efforts to help prevent
slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain:
   1. We periodically review our supply chain and supplier base to determine
      the level of risk associated with each supplier with respect to slavery
      and human trafficking based on our knowledge of their industries and
      their country of origin, and if we believe it is appropriate to do so, we
      will switch our source of supply to a supplier with a lower level of
      risk. Company employees and representatives conduct site visits of
      suppliers located outside of the United States on a periodic basis and
      confirm that based on their knowledge and information the supplier is not
      engaging in slavery or human trafficking. We have not yet begun
      conducting independent, unannounced audits of third party suppliers, nor
      have we used a third party to verify the risks in our supply chain.
   2. In order to meet the Act’s directive relating to supplier certification,
      each of our direct suppliers certifies to us that they adhere to the
      Velcro Supplier Code of Conduct, which can be found here.
   3. If we have reason to believe that a supplier is not in compliance with
      the Velcro Supplier Code of Conduct as it relates to the California
      Transparency in Supply Chain Act, we will take appropriate steps,
      including the elimination of the supplier from the Company’s supplier
      base or, if the violation is less severe, the opportunity to remedy the
      non-compliance through the development and execution of a corrective
      action plan.
   4. We ensure that key employees from our Procurement/Supply Chain
      organization are trained to identify and respond to supply chain risk
      issues such as forced or child labor as part of our procurement process
      and we will assess the need for additional or refresher training as
      appropriate.
   5. Our Company Code of Conduct includes language relating to slavery and
      human trafficking and we require each employee to acknowledge and adhere
      to the Code of Conduct. Failure to comply with the policy may result in
      disciplinary action up to and including termination.
The Company believes that the activities listed above will promote the goals of
the Act and help prevent slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain.
