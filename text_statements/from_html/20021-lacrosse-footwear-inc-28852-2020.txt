To address the regulations of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act
(SB 657), LaCrosse Footwear defines slavery as âthe act of holding the worker
against his or her will and controlled physically or psychologically by
violence or its threat for the purpose of appropriating their laborâ as used
by Free the Slaves (FTS). FTS is an international non-governmental organization
(NGO) that campaigns against the modern practice of slavery throughout the
world and is the largest anti-slavery organization in the United States.
LaCrosse Footwear defines human trafficking as âany recruitment, harboring,
transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor services, through
the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to
involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slaveryâ as defined in the
Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protections Act (TVPA) of 2000.
   1. LaCrosse Footwear assesses the risk of slavery and human trafficking thru
      a preliminary audit of its supply chain in order to qualify that
      supplier. This audit is performed by LaCrosse Footwear on potential
      suppliers thru factory visits by a contingent of LaCrosse Footwear's
      employees who work within supply chain functions. Audit includes on-site
      inspections, vendor profile assessment and Vendor Acknowledgement and
      Agreement.
   2. LaCrosse Footwear conducts follow up inspections of direct suppliers. We
      have developed and issued a code of conduct in our Vendor Acknowledgement
      and Agreement to our direct suppliers. Direct suppliers are evaluated on
      their compliance to our code though continued factory visits and
      monitoring.
   3. LaCrosse Footwear's purchasing agreements require all suppliers to comply
      with our Vendor Acknowledgement and Agreement and applicable laws within
      the country, or countries, they do business regarding slavery and human
      trafficking.
   4. LaCrosse Footwear maintains and enforces internal accountability
      procedures for employees and contractors regarding company standards in
      slavery and human trafficking. In the case of non-compliance, LaCrosse
      Footwear reserves the right to examine the specific situation and develop
      a best possible strategy for resolution. If cases of non-compliance are
      not resolved within a timely manner, LaCrosse Footwear may terminate the
      business relationship. While LaCrosse Footwear wishes to aid in the
      resolution of incidences of human trafficking and slavery within LaCrosse
      Footwear's supply chain, it is not possible to effectively solve the
      issue of noncompliance without the cooperation of the supplier.
   5. LaCrosse Footwear conducts internal training on LaCrosse Footwear's code
      of conduct to ensure the necessary participants in supply chain
      management are knowledgeable and aware of the issues and concerns
      surrounding the supply chain, including human trafficking and slavery,
      with a particular focus on mitigating risks. LaCrosse Footwear also
      encourages employees involved in LaCrosse Footwear's supply chain to
      participate in external training programs and seminars on social
      compliance issues, including on the issues of human trafficking and
      slavery.
