*** Our Commitment to Ending Modern-Day Slavery ***
Verification: Through a program of in-house and third-party audits, Hollander
Sleep Products, LLC evaluates and addresses any risks of human trafficking and
slavery in the supply chain wherever we do business.
Audits: Hollanderâs quarterly in-house audits throughout our supply chain
consist of on-site visits by trained personnel, records inspections, interviews
and detailed questionnaires to evaluate supplier compliance with local,
national and international standards for forced labor as well as Hollanderâs
own standards. Hollander also cooperates with our customers to conduct third-
party audits to assure compliance with these standards.
Certifications: Our suppliers must certify that materials they incorporate into
products Hollander buys comply with laws and our standards regarding slavery
and human trafficking.
Accountability: A key component of Hollanderâs efforts to enforce standards
regarding slavery and trafficking is the requirement that suppliers sign our
Business Code of Conduct which strictly forbids slavery, all forms of forced
labor and human trafficking. Suppliers who do not abide by our rules face
cancellation of future business.
Training: Hollander employees responsible for supply chain management have been
trained to recognize slavery and human trafficking and to respond promptly and
decisively to mitigate risk.
