****** California Transparency Act ******
At J.Crew, we believe that we have a responsibility to source our products in a
legal, ethical and responsible manner consistent with the highest standards.
The Responsible Sourcing program at J.Crew is in place to clearly communicate
our expectations to our suppliers and to monitor and improve working conditions
at the facilities that manufacture products for J.Crew, Madewell and crewcuts. 
We are proud of our efforts to monitor and improve working conditions around
the world. We are pleased to provide more information about these efforts so
that you, our customer, can be confident in your decision to purchase J.Crew,
Madewell and crewcuts products. As a company affected by the California
Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB657), we are providing the
following information about our program and our efforts to source our products
responsibly. The purpose of the law is to provide customers with the
information they need to make responsible and informed purchasing decisions.
Specifically, the information we have provided explains how we are working to
evaluate and address any risks of human trafficking and slavery in our supply
chain.
***** OUR EFFORTS TO ALIGN WITH BOTH THE LETTER AND THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW ARE
AS FOLLOWS: *****
**** ENGAGE IN VERIFICATION OF THE PRODUCT SUPPLY CHAINS TO EVALUATE AND
ADDRESS RISKS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND SLAVERY. ****
We have a robust Responsible Sourcing program in place to evaluate and address
risks in our supply chain, including the risk of human trafficking and slavery.
We have two full-time associates dedicated to social responsibility, and we
partner with leading independent organizations to implement various aspects of
our program, including conducting factory inspections, trainings and
remediation in the facilities that produce our goods. 
The primary focus of our Responsible Sourcing program is our direct
suppliers—those vendors and factories that manufacture J.Crew, Madewell and
crewcuts products on our behalf. We assess factory risk and determine our
inspection strategy based on location, previous inspection reports and volume
of production placed. We conduct regular inspections at the suppliers who
manufacture J.Crew, Madewell and crewcuts products to monitor compliance with
our Code of Vendor Conduct and related laws and regulations. All new factories
are subject to inspection before any purchase orders are placed. Existing
factories are typically inspected every 12 to 24 months unless follow-up is
required, in which case we will inspect more frequently. 
Similar to other retailers, our supply chain is complex and we have less
visibility of the indirect suppliers who provide fabric, trim and other
components to our direct suppliers, and even less visibility of the origin of
the raw materials of these components. Nevertheless, we recognize that we have
a responsibility to identify risks and to work to improve working conditions
throughout our supply chain. As a result, we regularly communicate with the
mill and trim suppliers with which we do business.
**** CONDUCT AUDITS OF SUPPLIERS TO EVALUATE SUPPLIER COMPLIANCE WITH COMPANY
STANDARDS FOR TRAFFICKING AND SLAVERY IN SUPPLY CHAINS. ****
We conduct regular inspections at the suppliers who manufacture J.Crew,
Madewell and crewcuts products to monitor compliance with our Code of Vendor
Conduct and related laws and regulations. We carefully select and rely on
independent external firms to conduct both announced and unannounced
inspections of manufacturing facilities and to help guide our program. In
partnership with these firms, we have developed inspection procedures that
address all the provisions covered by our Code of Vendor Conduct, including the
risk of human trafficking. 
A typical inspection consists of document reviews, private worker interviews
and a walk-through of the facility. When appropriate, we will also conduct
surveillance and off-site interviews. 
When issues of noncompliance are identified, it is our practice to work with
suppliers until they become compliant with our Code of Vendor Conduct. We aim
to provide suppliers with the tools they need to improve working conditions,
including training and in-factory consultations, and we conduct reinspections
when necessary to verify improvement. 
We terminate a business relationship only as a last resort, if a critical issue
of noncompliance is identified or when suppliers are unwilling to comply with
our requirements despite our efforts to help them become compliant.
**** REQUIRE DIRECT SUPPLIERS TO CERTIFY THAT MATERIALS INCORPORATED INTO THE
PRODUCT COMPLY WITH THE LAWS REGARDING HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND SLAVERY OF THE
COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY ARE DOING BUSINESS. ****
We seek to work with suppliers who share our commitment to responsible business
practices. The J.Crew Code of Vendor Conduct is the basis for the Responsible
Sourcing program at J.Crew and sets forth the guiding principles that are
expected of our suppliers. Our code prohibits the  use of forced labor of any
kind, including slavery and  human trafficking. 
Our vendors are contractually required to comply with our Responsible Sourcing
Supplier Guidelines, which include our Code of Vendor Conduct, program policies
and procedures and the requirement that our vendors do a reasonable inquiry to
ensure that their own suppliers operate legally. We have communicated similar
responsible sourcing expectations to the key mills that supply fabric for our
products.
**** MAINTAIN INTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES FOR EMPLOYEES OR
CONTRACTORS WHO FAIL TO MEET COMPANY STANDARDS REGARDING SLAVERY AND
TRAFFICKING. ****
All J.Crew associates are required to certify acceptance of our Code of Ethics
and Business Practices. Among other expectations, associates are expected to
act professionally and ethically and comply with all applicable laws where we
do business. Any failure to comply with the Code of Ethics and Business
Practices could lead to corrective action, up to and including termination. Our
Code of Ethics and Business Practices is available here. 
We seek to work with suppliers who share our commitment to responsible business
practices. Vendors are contractually required to comply with our Responsible
Sourcing Supplier Guidelines, which include our Code of Vendor Conduct. Any
failure to comply with our Responsible Sourcing guidelines could lead to
corrective action, up to and including termination of the business
relationship. Our Code of Vendor Conduct is available here.
**** PROVIDE COMPANY EMPLOYEES AND MANAGEMENT WHO HAVE DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE SUPPLY CHAIN WITH MANAGEMENT TRAINING ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND SLAVERY,
PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO MITIGATING RISKS WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHAIN OF
PRODUCTS. ****
The J.Crew Production department is responsible for managing the relationship
with our suppliers. Production and Responsible Sourcing work hand in hand to
monitor supplier conditions and achieve program goals. In 2011, we required
Production associates to participate in the University of Delaware's Risks of
Human Trafficking and Slavery Short Course webinar, designed specifically to
provide relevant information to sourcing professionals. In addition, we
regularly conduct training seminars for our Production team on our Responsible
Sourcing requirements and how to consistently manage suppliers to achieve our
Responsible Sourcing goals. 
In addition to internal trainings, we regularly conduct Responsible Sourcing
training seminars for suppliers. These seminars focus on our Code of Vendor
Conduct program requirements and other relevant topics, including working hours
and overtime, health and safety and management systems.
