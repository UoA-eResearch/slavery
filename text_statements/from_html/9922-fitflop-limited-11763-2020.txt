FitFlop Modern Slavery Transparency Statement - Financial Year 2018
Introduction
FitFlop is absolutely committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or
human trafficking in our business or supply chains; and to preventing modern
slavery and human trafficking in our corporate activities. This is our third
statement made pursuant to s.54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and relates to
our most recent financial year, which ended on 31 December 2018. This statement
sets out the potential risks related to our business, the steps that we have
taken during the past 12 months, and the steps that we will continue to take to
ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking are not taking place within
any part of our organisation and supply chain.
Over the past year we have continued to take active steps across our global
business to increase the depth and breadth of our work to ensure we identify
any instance of modern slavery practices and eliminate them from our supply
base. To this end we have also worked hard to educate and build knowledge in
this area within our own teams and those of our suppliers, distributors and
partners.
You can find out more below about our business and supply chains, our policies,
the due diligence processes we have in place, the steps we took in 2018 to
identify and mitigate the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking, and
the steps we will take in the coming year.
 
OUR BUSINESS AND SUPPLY CHAIN
FitFlop is a global, multi-channel brand
Launched in 2007, FitFlop™ is one of the world’s most popular makers of
biomechanically engineered shoes, sneakers and sandals, that not only look
good, but feel good and are good for you too. We are a global brand, providing
footwear and related items to customers and consumers in around 60 territories.
Business activities include the design, development, sourcing, manufacture,
transport and sale of products. We act as a holding company for subsidiary
undertakings in the US and Germany, with our headquarters in London and
operational offices in Hong Kong and Ho Chi Minh City.
We source finished footwear (“Tier 1”) from factories in Vietnam, China and
Indonesia. We also work directly with a number of component, material and
packaging suppliers (“Tier 2”) globally. We carry out testing and development
work in the UK, Canada, Vietnam, Indonesia and China. We have established long-
term relationships with several of our partners and have built these
relationships over many years in most cases. This enables us to gain a deeper
understanding of the issues faced by our suppliers.
 
DUE DILIGENCE
The primary risk for our business is in association with our suppliers in
relation to sourcing from countries outside of the UK, particularly those based
in Asia-Pacific countries. As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate
risk in our supply chains, we have systems in place to:
    * Identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply chains.
    * Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our
      supply chains.
    * Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains.
    * Protect whistle-blowers.
 
SUPPLIER REVIEWS
We undertake due diligence when considering new suppliers to take on and
regularly review our existing suppliers. We assess our supply chain to evaluate
particular geographical risks of modern slavery and human trafficking. We work
closely with our suppliers to understand their production processes and we make
it a contractual requirement that all manufacturers (Tier 1 and Tier 2), major
retailers, distributors, franchisees and major suppliers we do business with to
sign our Code of Conduct (see below). Employees from our London head office and
our regional offices in Hong Kong and Ho Chi Minh City regularly visit all our
suppliers. This gives us invaluable insight into working practices, processes
and conditions across our supply base, allowing us to spot potential issues
relating to modern slavery and human trafficking. In most cases we operate in
shared factory environments. We work with our industry partners in spotting and
addressing modern slavery and human trafficking issues.
 AUDITS
We work with specialist external auditors to carry out independent, third-party
audits every two years in the factories we use in all Tier 1 and all Tier 2
manufacturing locations. We employ a global specialist auditing firm to
evaluate our partners using the SMETA (SEDEX Members Ethical Trade Audit)
methodology, considered to be the gold standard and used by many other
established, responsible brands.
AUDIT OUTCOMES
We analyse the outcome of audits and decide what action, if any, needs to be
taken, including providing advice to suppliers through our third-party auditors
and our internal CSR team; requiring, where necessary, the factory to implement
corrective action plans. Should suppliers fail to take appropriate action on
any corrective measures or where they seriously violate our Code of Conduct, we
would consider invoking sanctions against them or terminating the business
relationship.
*****   *****
***** EMPLOYEE/WORKER DUE DILIGENCE *****
In each country where we employ staff, we ensure our compliance with the
relevant employment legislation. We recruit and select our own workers, with
the help of reputable recruitment agents or in-house recruiters, and determine
the terms and conditions of their employment. Employees/ workers are free to
accept or reject any employment offers made. As part of our recruitment process
we undertake checks on all workers to verify their identity, age and
eligibility to work in that country.
We always aim to pay our workers a reasonable and fair wage for the job they
are doing, and this will be at or above the legal minimum wage in the country
they are employed.
We require the same standards from our suppliers and we confirm this through
our audits. We also require the same or equivalent standards from our
distributor and franchise partners.
*****   *****
***** OUR POLICIES AND CONTRACTS *****
At FitFlop, our core values frame our approach to the prevention of modern
slavery and human trafficking and ensure that we are committed to acting
ethically and with integrity in all of our business relationships. Our core
values are:
BETTER... At what we do, all the time. By continually raising the bar on our
product, our communications, customer service, work output, efficiency, respect
for ourselves, our co-workers and our customers.
PROUD... Of every shoe we make, of our brand and its energy and of every
interaction we have on behalf of our company.
APPRECIATIVE... Of the opportunities we have, the people who work with and
support us, the retailers who stock us, the suppliers who supply us and the
customers who love us - we never take them for granted.
 
Key relevant policies are:
**** WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY ****
We strongly encourage all our workers and business partners to report any
concerns related to our activities or activities within our supply chains. Our
whistleblowing policy ensures that all workers know that they can raise
concerns about how workers are being treated, or practices within our business
or supply chain. This includes any circumstances that may give rise to an
enhanced risk of modern slavery and human trafficking. This policy is designed
to make it easy for workers to make disclosures, without fear of reprisals.
**** CODE OF CONDUCT ****
We are committed to ensuring that our suppliers adhere to the highest standards
of ethics. We require all product, materials and service suppliers,
distributors and franchisees to sign our Code of Conduct, which mandates the
following: safe and sanitary working conditions;
    * no forced labour;
    * no child labour;
    * no harassment or abuse;
    * no discrimination;
    * freedom of association and collective bargaining;
    * payment of at least minimum legal wage; and
    * working hours that are not excessive.
Suppliers are required to demonstrate that they provide safe working
conditions, treat workers with dignity and respect, and act ethically and
within the law in their use of labour. We work with suppliers to ensure that
they meet the standards of the Code and improve their workers' working
conditions. Serious violations of our Code of Conduct would lead to the
termination of the business relationship.
**** CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY POLICY ****
We continue to build our corporate social responsibility policy, which sets out
our commitment to preventing human-rights abuses, minimising environmental
damage and assuring fair business practices.
**** ANTI-BRIBERY POLICY ****
We have a comprehensive anti-bribery policy, supported by detailed guidance and
training.
**** CONTRACTS ****
Our standard manufacturer, distributor and franchisee terms require adherence
to our Code of Conduct. We also include contractual provisions that help us
implement and enforce our controls to identify, prevent and mitigate modern
slavery and human trafficking. These include provisions regarding auditing,
access to records, treatment of workers, anti-bribery and compliance with laws.
*****   *****
***** RISK MANAGEMENT/MITIGATION *****
Reporting on progress made in 2018
In 2017 we committed to take certain steps to further enhance our ongoing
efforts to identify, prevent and mitigate the risks of modern slavery and human
trafficking. Below we set out the progress we have made in 2018:
    * Staff training:To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of
      modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our
      business, we provide training to our staff. We have extended our formal
      modern slavery training programme to our entire Asia Pacific factory
      site-based teams, delivered by our third-party training partners. Our
      entire Asia Pacific factory team has now been trained in modern slavery
      and on audit principles, a significant increase on last year. This
      ensures constant vigilance, to mitigate risks that spot checks may not
      uncover.
    * Processes to encourage detection and reporting:Created new processes and
      procedures to encourage the reporting of issues spotted at factories.
      This includes providing all visitors with checklists in their travel
      packs, translating material into local languages and the creation of a
      new channel for employees to report concerns. We recognise the
      limitations of formal audits and have addressed this by supporting our
      visiting employees with a modern slavery toolkit. Encouraged the
      reporting of concerns and continue providing appropriate protection for
      whistle-blowers.
    * Strengthened supply chain auditing and verification:An independent third
      party conducts regular reviews to bring insights on ways to we can tackle
      slavery and human trafficking. We completed our 2016-2018 modern slavery
      audit cycle through SMETA. All tier one and tier two factory suppliers
      were audited. All corrective action plan meetings have been held.
    * FitFlop Code of Conduct:Maintained our existing Code of Conduct database
      and rolled out our new code of conduct to 100% of new retail franchisees
      and distributors.
    * Raising employee awareness:Raised awareness of modern slavery issues to
      all workers by circulating emails that explain: the basic principles of
      the Modern Slavery Act 2015; how workers can identify and prevent slavery
      and human trafficking; what workers can do to flag potential slavery or
      human trafficking issues to the relevant parties within the company; and
      what external help is available.
    * Supplier relationships:Continuing to review our existing supply chains,
      evaluating all existing and potential suppliers. Continued to build and
      maintain long-term relationships with our suppliers and clearly highlight
      to them our expectations of business behaviour.
    * Distributor and franchisee relationships: Adopted updated contract terms
      with appropriate modern slavery and human trafficking prevention clauses
      in relation to new distributor and franchisee contracts.
 
Our future areas of focus
In 2019 we commit to continue and improve our efforts to identify and mitigate
the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking. Over the coming year we plan
to focus on the following:
    * Commence a new modern slavery external audit cycle, starting with the
      renewal of audits with nine existing factory suppliers and two new tier 2
      suppliers in 2019.
    * Continue to review our franchisee operations.
    * Continue to review our existing supply chains, evaluating all existing
      and potential suppliers.
    * Raise awareness of modern slavery issues to all workers by circulating
      emails and providing internal posts on our intranet to explain: the basic
      principles of the Modern Slavery Act 2015; how workers can identify and
      prevent slavery and human trafficking; what workers can do to flag up
      potential slavery or human trafficking issues to the relevant parties
      within the company; and what external help is available.
    * Continue to build and maintain long-term relationships with our suppliers
      and clearly highlight to them our expectations of business behaviour. We
      will continue to create an environment of trust and transparency with
      suppliers and develop a deeper understanding of the issues our suppliers
      face.
    * Encourage the reporting of concerns and continue providing appropriate
      protection for whistle-blowers.
We will not support or deal with any business knowingly involved in modern
slavery and human trafficking.
