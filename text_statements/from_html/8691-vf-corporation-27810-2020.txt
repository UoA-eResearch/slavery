****** UK Slavery Act ******
At VF, our guiding principles are embedded in everything we do. We believe in
partnering with others who share our values and who understand the importance
of always conducting business ethically.
We are committed to taking steps to end forced labor, whether in the form of
human trafficking, indentured labor or otherwise. This statement outlines many
of our efforts to eradicate forced labor from our direct supply chains.
***** Our Business and Supply Chains *****
VF is a global leader in branded lifestyle apparel, footwear and accessories.
We own and operate several world-class manufacturing sites and, through our
network of nearly 70,000 associates, we share our values-driven internal
manufacturing model with our contracted suppliers. In addition to VF owned and
operated factories, our supply chain also includes sourcing, direct sourcing
and licensing. Sourcing comprises nearly 1,000 suppliers which are in more than
50 countries and represent much of our supply chain. Some of our brands choose
to participate in a direct sourcing model, where the brand selects its own
supplier independent of VFâs supplier network. Products supplied through
direct sourcing are typically specialty and limited release products.
Regardless of the model, these independently owned and operated suppliers are
subject to the compliance principles outlined in this statement.
***** Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Principles *****
All VF associates are governed by the VF_Code_of_Business_Conduct, which
forbids the use of forced or involuntary labor in any of our locations or in
the operations of facilities that produce goods for us.
We evaluate potential contracted factories against our rigorous standards and
require them to agree to VFâs Terms_of_Engagement prior to entering our
supply chain. By agreeing to our Terms of Engagement, contracted factories are
also bound by our Global_Compliance_Principles. Combined, these documents
provide clear guidance on VFâs expectations and address topics such as child
labor, forced labor, legal wages, discrimination, and harassment-free workplace
policies. They also prohibit contracted factories from engaging subcontractors
to produce VF products without the written permission of VF.
VF will not knowingly work with factories that use forced labor. We use our own
trained factory compliance auditors as well as accredited third-party auditors
to ensure compliance with our Terms of Engagement and Global Compliance
Principles. We also have signed various public pledges demonstrating our firm
opposition to the use of forced child and adult labor.
***** Risk Assessment and Due Diligence *****
At VF, the issue of where potential slavery and human trafficking risks may lie
in our operations and supply chain and how VF assesses and manages those risks
are addressed through our due diligence and audit processes. Before conducting
business with VF, each contracted factory must undergo a rigorous Factory
Compliance_Audit. Our on-site audit process includes scheduled and unannounced
audits by our trained factory compliance auditors and third-party audit
companies. We inspect for evidence of health and safety concerns, wage and
social compliance, forced labor, child labor issues, harassment-free workplace
policies, and environmental issues. To receive an âacceptedâ rating, a
factory must not have any serious health, safety or labor issues in its
facility. A factory receiving an accepted rating is authorized to produce our
products for one year, at which time it must undergo an annual review. A
factory receiving a âdevelopmentalâ rating may still produce our products,
but will be audited again every six months and must show continuous improvement
in health, safety, and labor issues. A factory with persistent safety, health,
or labor issues that fails to remediate issues within 180 days will be rejected
as our supplier and unauthorized to supply product for VF.
Our Terms of Engagement make it clear that contracted factories must conduct
business in full compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and
comply with the terms of our Global Compliance Principles. The Global
Compliance Principles specifically forbid the use of forced labor and prohibit
discrimination or harassment in the workplace. Each factory certifies
compliance with these terms and conditions prior to becoming an approved
contracted factory and is routinely audited for compliance.
In 2016, approximately 2,171 factories underwent our audit process, which
includes an assessment of indicators of human trafficking and labor law
violation risks. Of those, 141 factories were rejected for failing to meet one
or more of our standards. VF also partnered with a global non-profit
organization focused on third-party due diligence to begin implementation of a
risk-based process requiring all contracted factories to undergo additional
review procedures. The level of review is based on certain factors including
the factoryâs home countryâs level of perceived corruption, the relative
size of the factoryâs business with VF and any known reputational risks of
doing business with the factory. This process, which aims to achieve engagement
and transparency, requires factories to complete a questionnaire, provide
supporting documentation and certify compliance with relevant laws. The
implementation process is ongoing.
***** Training *****
VF associates receive assignments to complete online and facilitator-led
training on our Code of Business Conduct during their first thirty days and
sign an agreement to abide by its principles, including those related to human
trafficking and forced labor. For our associates and management who have direct
responsibility for monitoring, auditing and enforcing our Global Compliance
Principles, we provide additional training conducted by our staff or a third
party. Training includes topics such as identifying child labor, involuntary or
forced labor and preventing human trafficking.
***** Enforcement *****
All VF associates must comply with our Code of Business Conduct, which includes
principles relating to human trafficking and forced labor. Violation of our
Code of Business Conduct by one of our associates can result in disciplinary
action, including termination of employment. Consistent with internationally
recognized labor standards, our Global Compliance Principles specify minimum
working conditions for employees of our suppliers, helping to support the
principle that our values are reflected in our products. A contracted
factoryâs breach of the Terms of Engagement can result in VF taking
corrective action, including termination as an approved contracted factory.
All VF-owned and operated factories also undergo independent certification by a
non-profit organization that promotes global ethics in manufacturing.
***** Effectiveness *****
The VF Code of Business Conduct, our Ethics Helpline and the compliance
principles listed in this statement aim to help ensure that the use of forced
or involuntary labor in our supply chain is prevented. Our Terms of Engagement,
Global Compliance Principles, along with our actions through due diligence,
risk assessment, audits and training seek to ensure that our contracted
factories are free of known labor or employment supplied by or through slavery,
forced or compulsory labor or the product of human trafficking. Reviewing key
performance indicators such as audit statistics and helpline reports on an
ongoing basis allows us to update training for our auditors to identify and
report human trafficking and modern slavery issues, and leads to continuous
improvement in our practices. We continue to develop more comprehensive ways of
addressing the risks of slavery and human trafficking.
This statement covers January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017, and has been
approved by the Board of VF Corporation.
