****** California Supply Chains Act ******
To address the regulations of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act
of 2010 (SB 657):
   1. Kodiak-Terra USA Inc. assesses the risk of human trafficking and slavery
      related to the footwear supply chain. Country Risk Analysis is annually
      utilized to assess potential trafficking and forced labor risks. Risk
      assessment is performed either internally or externally, or both. We
      require that all manufacturing facilities comply with country and local
      labor laws as well as Williamson-Dickieâs Company policies. We hold all
      of our suppliers to the same standard and require that each abide by our
      âCode of Business Conduct and Ethicsâ policy. The Company will not
      knowingly conduct business with companies that use forced labor or other
      compulsory labor in the manufacture and distribution of products. The
      potential risk of labor brokers is considered.
   2. Kodiak-Terra USA Inc. conducts code of conduct and supply chain security
      audits of direct suppliers before we enter into any type of agreement or
      partnership. We have developed and issued a code of conduct to our direct
      suppliers. Direct suppliers are evaluated on their compliance of our code
      through audits renewed annually. If during the audit issues are
      identified, corrective actions are addressed and additional audits may be
      conducted as necessary to assure compliance. Our audits are generally
      announced with reserved right of unannounced visits and are performed by
      either third party or internal auditors, or both.
   3. Kodiak-Terra USA Inc.âs purchasing agreements require all suppliers to
      comply with applicable laws within the country of business, international
      standards, and trade regulations regarding human trafficking and slavery.
      The Company will not knowingly conduct business with suppliers that use
      forced labor or other compulsory labor. Verification of purchasing
      agreements are subject to inspection without notice.
   4. Kodiak-Terra USA Inc. maintains and rigorously enforces internal
      accountability procedures for employees and contractors regarding company
      standards in human trafficking and slavery. In the case of non-
      compliance, Kodiak-Terra USA Inc. reserves the right to examine the
      specific situation and in conjunction with the supplier develop a best
      possible strategy for resolution. If cases of non-compliance are not
      resolved within a timely manner, Kodiak-Terra USA Inc. may terminate the
      business relationship.
   5. Kodiak-Terra USA Inc. conducts internal training on Kodiak-Terra USA
      Inc.âs code of conduct and supply chain security to ensure the
      necessary participants in supply chain management are knowledgeable and
      aware of the issues and concerns surrounding the supply chain, including
      human trafficking and slavery, with a particular focus on mitigating
      risks. Kodiak-Terra USA Inc. requires employees involved in Kodiak-Terra
      USA Inc.âs supply chain to regularly participate in external training
      programs and seminars on social compliance issues, including a required
      course on the issues of human trafficking and slavery conducted by the
      University of Delaware.
