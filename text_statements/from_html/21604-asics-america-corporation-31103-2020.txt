****** ASICS California Privacy Notice ******

Effective Date: January 1, 2020

This notice reflects our good faith understanding of the law and our data
practices as of the date posted (set forth above), but the CCPAâs
implementing regulations are not yet final and there remain differing
interpretations of the law. Accordingly, we may from time-to-time update
information in this and other notices regarding our data practices and your
rights, modify our methods for responding to your requests, and/or supplement
our response to your requests, as we continue to develop our compliance program
to reflect the evolution of the law and our understanding of how it relates to
our data practices.
This California Privacy Notice (âNoticeâ) applies to âConsumersâ as
defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ) as a supplement to
ASICS America Corporationâs and ASICS Digital Inc.âs (collectively,
âCompanyâ, âusâ, âweâ, or ourâ) other privacy policies or
notices. In the event of a conflict between any other Company policy, statement
or notice and this Notice, this Notice will prevail as to California Consumers
and their rights under the CCPA. Please see also any privacy policy or notice
of general applicability posted or referenced on our websites, applications,
products, or services including, without limitation, www.asics.com,
www.onitsukatiger.com, www.runkeeper.com, www.id.asics.com, and
www.asicsstudio.com. In addition, this Notice applies to California users of
the ASICS MOBILE FOOT ID application.
This Notice covers the collection, use, disclosure, and sale of California
Consumersâ âPersonal Informationâ (âPIâ) as defined by the CCPA,
except to the extent such PI is exempt from the notice obligations of the CCPA.
This Notice also covers rights California Consumers have under the CCPA, as
well as other notices to Californians required by other laws. The description
of our data practices in this Notice, as required by the CCPA, covers only
calendar year 2019 and will be updated annually. Our practices in calendar year
2020 may change, however, if materially different such that we think a Consumer
would reasonably expect notice we will provide notice in connection with the
applicable collection and use, which may include reference to other applicable
privacy policies and notices.
Consistent with the CCPA, job applicants, current and former employees and
independent contractors (collectively, âPersonnelâ), and subjects of
certain business-to-business communications acting solely in their capacity as
representatives of another business, are not considered âConsumersâ for
purposes of this California Privacy Notice or the rights described herein.
However, our Personnel may obtain a separate privacy notice that is applicable
to them by contacting their local Human Resources department. Publicly
available information is also not treated as PI under the CCPA, so this notice
is not intended to apply to that data and your Consumer privacy rights do not
apply to that data.
Terms defined in the CCPA that are used in this Notice shall have the same
meaning as in the CCPA.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in our other privacy notices, we
typically restrict use of your PI that is governed by the CCPAâs Consumer
rights provisions and is shared with our vendors for business purposes.
In addition, if you direct us to share PI we may, and that is not a sale. Also,
disclosures amongst the entities that constitute Company, as defined above, and
their Service Providers are not sales.

*** i. Sale ***
We do not sell your PI as such is defined under the CCPA, and until such time
as we change this policy by updating this Privacy Notice, we will treat PI
collected under this policy as subject to a do not sell request.

respect to cookies, including certain types of interest-based advertising, see

***** 2. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS *****
The CCPA is a new law and there remain differing interpretations of it and the
regulations that implement it. Accordingly, we may from time-to-time update
information in our notices regarding our data practices and your rights, modify
our methods for you to make and for us to respond to your requests, and/or
supplement our response(s) to your requests, as we continue to develop our
compliance program to reflect the evolution of the law and our understanding of
how it relates to our data practices.
We provide California Consumers the privacy rights described in this section.
You have the right to exercise these rights via an authorized agent who meets
the agency requirements of the CCPA and related regulations. As permitted by
the CCPA, any request you submit to us is subject to an identification process
(âVerifiable Consumer Requestâ). We will not fulfill your CCPA request
unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you
are the Consumer about whom we collected PI. Please follow the instructions at
our Consumer Rights Request page here or call us at (844) 278-2826 (for ASICS,
Onitsuka Tiger and OneASICS) or (844) 702-9037 (for Runkeeper, MOBILE FOOT ID
and ASICS Studio) and respond to any follow up inquires we may make. You may
also obtain information on how to make, and may submit, a request by asking a
manager at any of our retail locations.
Some PI we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough
PI about the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular
Consumerâs PI when a Consumer request that requires verification pursuant to
the CCPAâs verification standards is made (e.g., clickstream data tied only
to a pseudonymous browser ID). As required by the CCPA, we do not include that
PI in response to those requests. If we cannot comply with a request, we will
explain the reasons in our response. You are not required to create an account
with us to make a Verifiable Consumer Request, but you may use your OneASICS
account to do so. We will use PI provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only
to verify your identity or your authority to make the request and to track and
document request responses, unless you also gave it to us for another purpose.
We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer PI that we
collect, process, store, disclose and otherwise use and to respond to your
California Consumer rights requests. In some cases, particularly with
voluminous and/or typically irrelevant data, we may suggest that you receive
the most recent or a summary of your PI and give you the opportunity to elect
whether you want the rest or not. We reserve the right to direct you to where
you may access and copy responsive PI yourself. We will typically not charge a
fee to fully respond to your requests; provided, however, that we may charge a
reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive,
repetitive, unfounded or overly burdensome. If we determine that the request
warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining
why we made that decision. You will be provided a cost estimate and the
opportunity to accept such fees before we will charge you for responding to
your request.
Consistent with the CCPA and our interest in the security of your PI, we will
not deliver to you an account password or security questions or answers in
response to a CCPA request; however, you may be able to access some of this
information yourself through your account if you have an active account with
us. Your California Consumer rights are as follows:

**** A. The Right to Know ****

*** i. Information Rights ***
You have the right to send us a request, no more than twice in a twelve-month
period, for any of the following for the period that is twelve months prior to
the request date:
    * The categories of PI we have collected about you.
    * The categories of sources from which we collected your PI.
    * The business or commercial purposes for our collecting or selling your
      PI.
    * The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your PI.
    * The specific pieces of PI we have collected about you.
    * A list of the categories of PI disclosed for a business purpose in the
      prior 12 months, or that no disclosure occurred.
    * A list of the categories of PI sold about you in the prior 12 months, or
      that no sale occurred. If we sold your PI, we will explain:
          o The categories of your PI we have sold.
          o The categories of third parties to which we sold PI, by categories
            of PI sold for each third party.
To make a request, click_here, or call us at (844) 278-2826 (for ASICS,
Onitsuka Tiger and OneASICS) or (844) 702-9037 (for Runkeeper, MOBILE FOOT ID
and ASICS Studio). You will be asked to provide your name, email address,
country of residence, and request details. For your specific pieces of
information, as required by the CCPA, we will apply the heightened verification
standards set forth in subsection (ii) below.
Please note that PI is retained by us for various time periods, so we may not
be able to fully respond to what might be relevant beyond the 12 months prior
to the request.

*** ii. Obtaining Copies of PI ***
You have the right to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice
in a twelve-month period, of your PI that we have collected and are maintaining
for the period that is 12 months prior to the request date. To make a request,
click_here, or call us at (844) 278-2826 (for ASICS, Onitsuka Tiger and
OneASICS) or (844) 702-9037 (for Runkeeper, MOBILE FOOT ID and ASICS Studio).
You will be asked to provide your name, email address, country of residence,
and request details. A confirmation email will be sent to your email address to
verify your identity.
Please note that PI is retained by us for various time periods, so we may not
be able to fully respond to what might be relevant beyond the 12 months prior
to the request.

**** B. Do Not Sell ****
We do not believe that we sell your PI as such is defined under the CCPA, and
until such time as we change this policy by updating this Privacy Notice, will
treat PI collected under this policy as subject to a do not sell request.
However, while there is not yet a consensus, and although we think otherwise,
data practices of third-party cookies and tracking technologies associated with
our websites and mobile applications may potentially be determined to
constitute a âsaleâ of your PI as defined by the CCPA. Because we do not
think these third-party activities are a sale by us, we do not offer a do not
sell option. However, you can exercise control over browser-based cookies by
adjusting the settings on your browser, and mobile devices may offer ad and
data limitation choices. In addition, third party tools may enable you to
search for and opt-out of some of these trackers, such as the Ghostery browser
plug-in available at https://www.ghostery.com/. We do not represent that these
third-party tools, programs or statements are complete or accurate, clearing
cookies or changing settings may affect your choices and you may have to opt-
out separately via each browser and other device you use. For more information
on cookies and other tracking technologies that may be associated with our web
sites and mobile applications, and ways you may exercise preferences regarding
them, see our Cookie Policies (ASICS | Onitsuka_Tiger | OneASICS | Runkeeper |
ASICS_Studio | MOBILE_FOOT_ID).
Some browsers have signals that may be characterized as do not track signals,
but we do not understand them to operate in that manner or to indicate a do not
sell expression by you, so we currently do not recognize these as do not sell
requests. We understand that various parties are developing do not sell signals
and we may recognize certain such signals if we conclude such a program is
appropriate.
We will not knowingly sell the PI of Consumers under 16.
We may disclose your PI for the following purposes, which are not a sale: (i)
if you direct us to share your PI; (ii) to comply with your requests under the
CCPA; (iii) disclosures amongst the entities that constitute Company as defined
above, to Companyâs Service Providers, or as part of a merger or asset sale;
and (iv) as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.

**** C. Delete ****
Except to the extent we have a basis for retention under the CCPA, you may
request that we delete your PI that we have collected directly from you and are
maintaining. Our retention rights include, without limitation, to complete
transactions and provide services you have requested or that are reasonably
anticipated, for security purposes, for legitimate internal business purposes,
including maintaining business records, to comply with law, to exercise or
defend legal claims, and to cooperate with law enforcement. Note also that we
are not required to delete your PI that we did not collect directly from you.
To make a request, click_here, or call us at (844) 278-2826 (for ASICS,
Onitsuka Tiger and OneASICS) or (844) 702-9037 (for Runkeeper, MOBILE FOOT ID
and ASICS Studio). You will be asked to provide your name, email address,
country of residence, and request details. A confirmation will be sent to your
email address to verify your identity and to confirm that you want to delete
your information.
However, you may alternatively exercise more limited control of your PI by
instead exercising one of the following more limited opt-out: such as opting
out of marketing communications or deleting one of your ASICS accounts by
visiting our Privacy_Hub or by visiting and editing your account settings.

**** D. Non-Discrimination and Financial Incentive Programs ****
We do not currently offer any incentive programs requiring you to waive any of
your CCPA rights. If we implement any programs that require you to limit your
CCPA rights in connection with charging a different price or rate, or offering
a different level or quality of good or service, we may do so, on an opt-in
basis, to the extent that program benefits are reasonably related to the value
of the applicable data. Otherwise, we will not discriminate based on the
exercise of CCPA rights in offering prices or services. In addition, we may
offer you financial incentives for the collection, sale and retention and use
of your PI as permitted by the CCPA that can, without limitation, result in
reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels. The material aspects of
any financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms.
Please note that participating in incentive programs is entirely optional, you
will have to affirmatively opt-in to the program and you can opt-out of each
program (i.e., terminate participation and forgo the ongoing incentives)
prospectively by following the instructions in the applicable program
description and terms. We may add or change incentive programs and/or their
terms by posting notice on the program descriptions so check them regularly.

**** E. Authorized Agents ****
You may designate an agent to exercise your CCPA rights on your behalf. To
exercise your rights via an agent, your agent must (1) show proof of
registration with the California Attorney Generalâs Office as your power of
attorney; or (2) submit a written authorization of his or her authority to act
on your behalf. Once such authorization is submitted, you will receive an email
at your email address asking you to verify the agentâs authority to submit a
Consumer Rights Request on your behalf. Once your agentâs authorization is
verified (s)he may exercise rights on your behalf.

**** F. Limitations on Rights ****
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we may collect, use and disclose your
PI as required or permitted by applicable law and this may override your CCPA
rights. In addition, we need not honor any of your requests to the extent that
doing so would infringe upon our or any other person or partyâs rights or
conflict with applicable law.

***** 3. ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIA NOTICES *****
In addition to CCPA rights, certain Californians are entitled to certain other
notices, including:

**** A. Third Party Marketing and Your California Privacy Rights ****
Separate from your CCPA âDo Not Sellâ rights, Californiaâs âShine the
Lightâ law permits California residents to request certain information
regarding our disclosure of PI to third parties for their own direct marketing
purposes.
We do not share personal information as defined by California Civil Code Â§
1798.83 (âShine the Light lawâ) with third parties for their direct
marketing purposes without either obtaining your consent or giving you the
ability to opt-out. To opt-out of future sharing with third parties for their
direct marketing purposes, click_here. If you are a California resident, you
may request information about our compliance with the Shine the Light law by
contacting us here or by sending a letter, to the following address, as
applicable:
For ASICS, Onitsuka Tiger, and OneASICS:

Attention: General Counsel
For ASICS Studio, Runkeeper and MOBILE FOOT ID:

Any such request must include âCalifornia Privacy Rights Requestâ in the

state, and ZIP code. Please note that we are only required to respond to one
request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests
made by means other than through this email address or mail address.
As these rights and your CCPA rights are not the same and exist under different
laws, you must exercise your rights under each law separately.

**** B. Online Privacy Practices ****

*** i. Tracking and Targeting ***
When you visit our online services, we and third parties may use tracking
technologies to collect usage information based on your device for a variety of
purposes, including serving you advertising, based on your having visited our
services or your activities across time and third-party locations. Some
browsers may enable you to turn on or off a so-called âDo Not Trackâ
signal. Because there is no industry consensus on what these signals should
mean and how they should operate, we do not look for or respond to âDo Not
Trackâ signals. For more information on tracking and targeting and your
choices regarding these practices, see our online Privacy Policies (ASICS |

can request removal by contacting us here, detailing where the content or
information is posted and attesting that you posted it. We will then make
reasonably good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view
or anonymize it, so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent
required by applicable law. This removal process cannot ensure complete or
comprehensive removal. For instance, third parties may have republished or
archived content by search engines and others that we do not control.

**** D. Supply Chain ****
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB657) requires
retail sellers and manufacturers doing business in California to disclose their
efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their direct supply
chain.
We use the below accepted definitions of Slavery and Human Trafficking to
formulate this disclosure:
Slavery is âthe most extreme version of forced labor where a person is under
the absolute control of another person who exercises powers of ownership. The
arrangement is permanent in nature and, in some cases, based on descent. The
enslaved person is treated as a commodity and property and is restricted in
terms of freedom of movementâ, as defined by several in the NGO community.
Human Trafficking is âany recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision,
or obtaining of a person for labor services, through the use of force, fraud,
or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage,
debt bondage, or slaveryâ, as defined in the Victims of Trafficking and
Violence Protections Act (VTVPA) of 2000. Human trafficking is also known as
the modern-day slave trade.
We condemn the use of force or involuntary labor and deploy international
monitors as well as certified third-party auditors to verify its supply chain
compliance to this zero-tolerance point.
Many years ago, we realized that workersâ conditions everywhere were a vital
component of a sound supply chain and have dedicated a team of Corporate Social
Responsibility (CSR) specialists to monitor vendor compliance and performance
in agreement with our vendor Policy of Engagement and Code of Conduct.
Manufacturing partners sign a vendor agreement which includes agreement to
comply with our Policy of Engagement. Not meeting these terms can result in the
termination of the business relationship. This policy is based on ASICS
Philosophy, ASICS Vision and ASICS Code of Conduct as well as the World
Federation of Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI) model Code of Conduct.
Our vendor agreement requires all suppliers to operate in full compliance with
all national and local laws, rules and regulations applicable to their business
operations and in cases where no local laws exist, and we expect international
standards to be followed.
Our global supply chain partners are evaluated on their compliance with the
Policy of Engagement based on a combination of announced and unannounced audits
conducted by third-party accredited monitors as well as internal compliance
specialists.
Over and above our vendor requirements and expectations, âASICS Code of
Conductâ sets out the basic standards by which all members of ASICS Group
must comply during their daily activities and with each business decision. All
directors, officers and employees in ASICS Group are required to review,
understand and comply with this Code.
We provide training to ensure the necessary participants in supply chain
management are knowledgeable and aware of the issues and concerns surrounding
the supply chain, including human trafficking and slavery with a particular
focus on mitigating risks. We work with third-party trainers and invite factory
management to participate in CSR seminars, trainings and or conferences in the
bigger manufacturing centers around the world.
