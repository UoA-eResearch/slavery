***** Social Responsibility *****

***** AAFA/FLA Apparel & Footwear Industry Commitment to Responsible
Recruitment October 2018 *****
Reducing potential forced labor risks for migrant workers in the global supply
chain is next to impossible for a single company and true progress towards
these goals can only be made when the industry works collectively. Together the
American Apparel & Footwear Association, the Fair Labor Association, Lucky
Brand, and over 100 apparel and footwear companies signed the âAAFA/FLA
Apparel & Footwear Industry Commitment to Responsible Recruitmentâ on October
22nd.
The Commitment is a proactive industry effort and each signatory commits to
working with its partners to create conditions where:
    * No worker pays for their job
    * Workers retain control of their travel documents and have full freedom of
      movement
    * Workers are informed of the basic terms of their employment before
      joining the workforce
The signing companies also agree to strive âseriously and effectivelyâ to
implement these practices by incorporating the Commitment into their social
compliance standards by December 31, 2019, and to periodically report the
companyâs actions.
Our industry does not tolerate forced labor and we take this issue seriously
and are proactively working together to initiate measures to ensure these
values are respected throughout the supply chain. The full text of the
Commitment to Responsible Recruitment, details, and information on how
companies can join the Commitment can be found at here.

***** U.N. Human Rights Council *****
***** June 2018 *****
The Lucky Brand Supplier Code of Conduct is founded on the âILO_eight
fundamental_conventionsâ and the âU.N._Universal_Declaration_of_Human
Rights.â The U.N. Human Rights Council is an inter-governmental body
responsible for the promotion and protection of all human rights around the
globe. Despite the United States withdraw from the U.N. Human Rights Council,
Lucky Brand stands by its company commitment to ensure the fundamental human
rights and dignity of factory workers in our supply chain.

***** LUCKY BRAND SOCIAL COMPLIANCE PROGRAM *****
***** POLICIES *****
Lucky Brandâs internal policies ensure supplier awareness that slavery, human
trafficking, forced labor, and child labor in our supply chains will not be
tolerated. These policies also outline Luckyâs standards for a safe and
healthy working environment in the factories where we source product.
These policies are outlined in the Lucky Brand Supplier Code of Conduct and the
Supplier Social Compliance Manual. The Supplier Code of Conduct is based on
United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (âUDHRâ), the
International Labour Organization (ILO) Fundamental Conventions, and
benchmarked to industry standards. Lucky Brand suppliers are expected to
implement the Lucky Brand Supplier Code of Conduct, using the guidance provided
in the Social Compliance Manual, in their facilities and to comply with all
relevant and applicable laws and regulations of the country in which workers
are employed.

***** CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT OF 2010 (SB 657) *****
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB_657) went into
effect January 1, 2012. This law requires large retailers and manufacturers
that do business in the state of California, with gross worldwide sales of over
$100 million dollars, to be transparent about the efforts they have undertaken
to eradicate Slavery and Human Trafficking in their supply chain.
(SB 657) takes me here https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/164934.pdf

    * Forced labor is "all work or service which is exacted from any person
      under the menace of any penalty and for which said person has not offered
      himself voluntarily" (Forced_Labour_Convention,_1930).
    * Child Labor is often defined as work that deprives children of their
      childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to
      physical and mental development (International_Labor_Organization).
    * Slavery, currently referred to as modern-day slavery, includes debt
      bondage, serfdom, forced marriage and the delivery of a child for the
      exploitation of that child (1956_UN_supplementary_convention).

***** 1. SUPPLY CHAIN DUE DILIGENCE AND VERIFICATION *****
The Lucky Brand Supplier Code of Conduct is communicated to all finished goods
suppliers and prohibits any form of forced labor in our supply chain, including
human trafficking, slavery, and child labor. Suppliers sign off on their
receipt of and compliance with the Lucky Brand Supplier Code of Conduct. By
signing off on the Code of Conduct, the supplier agrees to Lucky making both
announced and unannounced audits by third-parties. The Code resides within the
Lucky Brand Supplier Social Compliance Manual, which is the process document
that guides factories to implement the Code of Conduct on the work floor.

***** 2. MONITORING *****
The Lucky Brand Supplier Social Compliance Manual includes details on Luckyâs
procedure to audit, identify, and correct violations of our Code. It also
explains the screening process for potential suppliers, ensuring Lucky does not
embark on business relationships with suppliers that have substandard human
rights practices. We conduct or collect audits for all of our finished goods
suppliers to ensure compliance with our Code of Conduct. Audits are performed
by an approved list of reputable third-party monitors. As per the Code,
suppliers agree to announced and unannounced audits. Because Lucky strives for
collaborative compliance relationships with its suppliers, unannounced audits
are only scheduled when deemed necessary.
After an audit, suppliers are given guidance on how to create corrective action
plans for audit findings. Audits and corrective action plans are reviewed for
compliance with the Lucky Code. Audit reports always include detailed sections
on child and forced labor, migrant, imported, contract and temporary/seasonal
workers, and third-party labor brokers and temporary agencies. Should a
supplier fail to meet Lucky Brandâs standards, appropriate and timely
corrective action is expected. Failure to do so could result in the
cancellation of purchase orders and/or termination of the business
relationship.

***** Lucky Brandâs Mutual Recognition Program *****
Audit fatigue is a common struggle in the process of monitoring and evaluating
suppliers. The resources and time it takes to host an audit distracts the
factory from making actual policy and procedural changes. Since an audit is
simply a snapshot in time, Lucky Brand believes healthy work environments are
ensured by a strong internal health and safety program. A supplierâs energies
should be focused on developing and implementing this program. In such, Lucky
Brand has a Mutual Recognition Program, also known as Equivalence, where
international industry standard audits are accepted even if they were conducted
on behalf of another brand or retailer. We believe this allows the supplier to
focus energies on long-term preventive actions instead of audit preparation.
Lucky Brand is supportive of the Social_Labor_and_Convergence_Project, which
would create a single verification accepted by all Brands and Retailers. We are
waiting for the Five-Year Strategy in Q4 2018 to be announced before making a
public commitment.

***** 3. CERTIFICATION *****
Lucky Brand suppliers are prohibited from utilizing unauthorized subcontractors
to produce Lucky Brand products or components without prior approval. Lucky
approval requires an audit of the subcontractor prior to work beginning to
ensure compliance with our Code of Conduct.

***** 4. EVALUATING RISK AND ACCOUNTABILITY *****
Lucky Brandâs social compliance program is reviewed annually or more
frequently if internal company changes deem it necessary. Luckyâs social
compliance program has recently undergone the following revisions due to
internal changes:
    * In Q4 2014 and Q1 2015, Luckyâs social compliance program was reviewed
      and the Code of Conduct and Supplier Social Compliance Manual were
      revised after a divestment from Kate Spade & Company to ensure synergy
      with new internal processes. At the same time, the former program was
      reviewed for gaps and strengthened where required.
    * In Q4 2015 and Q1 2016, the utilization of a new audit tool was reviewed
      and implemented, along with procedures to avoid audit duplication (or
      audit fatigue), enhanced systems to manage corrective action plans, and
      improved supplier trainings.
    * In 2017 a new Supplier Scorecard was launched and suppliers were notified
      by in-person trainings. The Supplier Scorecard is a tool that supports
      the Mutual Recognition Program and allows Lucky to track progress over
      time and evaluate risk regardless of the audit provided.
    * In 2018, the new Supplier Scorecard has enabled us to focus on factories
      and allocated resources to more in-depth capacity building programs or
      trainings based on the historical trends of their audit reports.
Communication with Lucky Global Sourcing about a supplierâs social compliance
level is fluid, ongoing, and based on a supplierâs current needs. Global
Sourcing is always notified of severe changes to a supplierâs compliance
level.
Any form of forced labor, including slavery and human trafficking is a zero-
tolerance issue for Lucky Brand. If this were found in our supply chain, the
supplier would be subject to disciplinary actions including immediate
remediation and possible termination of business. Aside from zero-tolerance
issues, Lucky strives to form long-term relationships and work with our
supplies in an effort of continuous improvement.

***** 5. TRAINING *****
Due to their frequent factory visits, Lucky Brand sees our Global Sourcing and
Design Teams as the eyes and ears of the Social Compliance Program. These Teams
are trained in Social Auditor 101 to be familiar with the following:
    * Definition of slavery, human trafficking, debt bondage, forced labor, and
      child labor;
    * Methods or red flags to recognize the signs of human trafficking in the
      supply chain and how to respond appropriately;
    * Health & Safety Walkthrough to identify issues in Fire, Electrical, and
      Chemical safety and proper use of personal protective equipment.

Your interest in our program is important to us. If you have questions or would
