    * Modern Slavery Statement
****** Modern Slavery Agreement ******
===============================================================================
In compliance with the regulations of both the UK Modern Slavery Act and the
Californian Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657), this statement sets out
Thomas Pinkâs policies and actions relating to the prevention of slavery and
human trafficking in our business and supply chain.
We are committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking within our
business activities and to ensure that our supply chains are free from modern
slavery and human trafficking in any form.
This statement relates to actions and activities during the last financial year
1st January 2016 to 31st December 2016.
Organisational structure and supply chains
Countries of operation:
Part of the Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy group (âLVMHâ) Thomas Pink is a
modern British shirtmaker with flagship stores in Londonâs Jermyn Street,
Madison Avenue, New York and Rue Francois Premier, Paris. Thomas Pink has
stores in the UK, Ireland, USA (including California) and France and has a
global franchise network including Mexico, Australia, China and South Africa.
In addition to its shirt ranges, Thomas Pink carries a range of silk ties,
tailoring, knitwear and accessories.
Countries of supply:
Thomas Pink sources its products from approximately 80 suppliers. During the
year the majority of products are sourced from supplier sites in Malaysia,
Vietnam, China, UK and Italy. The majority of fabrics are purchased from
reputable mills in the UK, Italy and China which meet Thomas Pinkâs high-
quality standards. Thomas Pink exercises caution when approving suppliers to
ensure that products are only sourced in countries that respect human rights.
High-risk activities:
Thomas Pink is aware that some of its operations are considered to be at a
higher risk of slavery or human trafficking and is working with its supply
chain to mitigate these risks. For example Thomas Pink is a member of the
Better Cotton Initiative âBCIâ. The BCI exists to make global cotton
production better for the people who produce it, promoting decent work
practices in the cotton fields, specifically banning child and forced labour.
Thomas Pink is working to increase the amount of cotton bought from better
cotton sources.
Responsibility:
Responsibility for Thomas Pinkâs anti-slavery initiatives lies with the
Production and Human Resources Teams. Risk assessments, due diligence and
training are carried out by these teams who then review policies as required
and submit any necessary revisions to the responsible board member for
approval.
Relevant Policies
Thomas Pink has developed the following policies to address human trafficking
and slavery in itsâ supply chain and business. All policies are available to
employees through a central online database.
Employee Code of Conduct:
Thomas Pink’s Employee Code of Conduct sets out the ethical and practical
framework within which employees are invited to act. A fundamental part of this
is to respect and defend the principles of theÂ UN_Global_CompactÂ in the
workplace, one of these being the elimination of any form of forced or bonded
labour.
Ethical Sourcing Policy:
Thomas_Pink’s_Ethical_Sourcing_PolicyÂ contains direct references to human
trafficking and modern slavery. This states that employment should be freely
chosen and that no forced, bonded or involuntary prison labour will be
tolerated. Suppliers whom engage in or support slavery or human trafficking in
any way will not be used.
Whistleblowing Policy:
During 2016, Thomas Pink developed a Whistleblowing Policy which sets out to
ensure that protections are in place for those who raise legitimate concerns
over wrongdoing within its own operations.
Due Diligence and Verification
Thomas Pink undertakes due diligence when considering new suppliers and
regularly reviews existing suppliers, using a variety of tools to assess
potential and existing supply chain partners in all tiers.
Code of Conduct:
All suppliers receive a copy of the Thomas Pink Supplier Manual and must sign a
declaration to confirm acceptance of the terms and conditions. Incorporated
within this is Thomas Pinkâs Supplier Code of Conduct and Ethical Sourcing
Policy.
Supplier Management and Supplier Ethical Data Exchange âSEDEXâ:
Thomas Pink requests and commissions independent 3rd party ethical audits from
tier 1, 2 and 3 suppliers. Thomas Pink visits suppliers on a regular basis and
conducts 2nd Party SMETA (SEDEX Members Ethical Trading Audits) ethical audits
on factories in the UK. Thomas Pink is also a member of SEDEX. SEDEX is a not
for profit membership organisation dedicated to driving improvements in ethical
and responsible business practices in global supply chains. Thomas Pink uses
SEDEX to store and review audits from suppliers.
Corrective Actions:
Non-compliances found during ethical audits, whistleblowing or other methods
form the basis for Corrective Action Plans (âCAPsâ). All suppliers are
encouraged to work through their CAPs in a timely fashion and Thomas Pink
supports suppliers with their CAPs as required. If critical issues such as
evidence of human trafficking are found, business would be suspended until
corrected and terminated permanently if the issues are not resolved. Whilst
Thomas Pink aims to support suppliers in the resolution of incidences of human
trafficking and slavery within the supply chain and recognises that it is not
possible to effectively solve the issue without the full cooperation of the
supplier.
Supply Chain Mapping:
Thomas Pink began mapping its supply chains, starting with 15 top suppliers in
late 2014 to assess where risks may lie within its supply chain. Suppliers are
now requested to disclose information on their trim and component suppliers as
standard practice when beginning work with Thomas Pink.
Training and Awareness Raising
All retail managers and head office staff joining the business attend a company
induction where Thomas Pinkâs ethical and environmental sourcing policies,
including those on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking, are explained.
Thomas Pink continues to develop training for those who are involved directly
with supply chain management, to improve knowledge and awareness of the issues
and concerns surrounding Modern Slavery. Thomas Pink also encourages employees
within the Production and Human Resources teams to participate in external
training programs and seminars on social compliance issues, human trafficking
and modern slavery.
