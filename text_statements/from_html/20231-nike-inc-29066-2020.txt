****** NIKE STATEMENT ON FORCED LABOR, HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND MODERN SLAVERY FOR
FISCAL YEAR 2019 ******
** I. BACKGROUND **
At NIKE, we believe we have a responsibility to conduct our business in an
ethical way. We expect the same from our suppliers, and focus on working with
long-term, strategic suppliers that demonstrate a commitment to engaging their
workers, providing safe working conditions and advancing environmental
responsibility. This includes working to combat risks of forced labor, modern
slavery and human trafficking.
For more information on NIKE's sustainable engagement in our supply chain,
please see our annual Impact_Report that details some of the drivers we have in
place to transform our working relationships with suppliers to incentivize
changes that benefit their workers.
The following provides information required under the UK Modern Slavery Act of
2015 and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 as they
relate to NIKEâs business practices, and specifically how we address issues
of forced labor.
** II. NIKE OVERVIEW AND SUPPLY CHAIN STRUCTURE **
NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We
sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital
platforms, to retail accounts and through a mix of independent distributors,
licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the
world. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent
contractors.
We are focusing on quality, long-term supply agreements with fewer factories,
that are committed to our strict standards of sustainability and product
excellence. Our sourcing strategy prioritizes and favors suppliers that show
demonstrable leadership in corporate responsibility and sustainability, seeking
to move beyond minimum standards. As part of our growth strategy, we seek
suppliers who drive sustainable business growth by minimizing their
environmental impacts, fostering a strong culture of safety and developing an
engaged and valued workforce.
NIKE has disclosed the independent factories contracted to make NIKE products
since 2005. An interactive map of NIKEâs current suppliers can be found here:
http://manufacturingmap.nikeinc.com/. The map includes the supplier group,
location of the facility, type of products produced, number of workers, and
information on the workforce profile including percentage employment of women
and migrant workers.
NIKEâs commitment to ethical practices in our own operations and our supply
chain begins at the highest level â from our CEO and Board of Directors.
NIKE, Inc.âs Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee
of the Board of Directors review and evaluate the Companyâs significant
strategies, activities, policies, investments and programs regarding corporate
purpose, including corporate responsibility, sustainability, human rights,
global community and social impact, and diversity and inclusion; and, provide
oversight of managementâs efforts to ensure that the Companyâs dedication
to sustainability (including environmental and supply chain sustainability and
human rights) is reflected in its business operation.
NIKEâs Purpose Committee â composed of our Chief Administrative Officer,
Chief Communications Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer,
Chief Marketing Officer, President Consumer and Marketplace, Executive Vice
President Global Human Resources, Vice President/General Manager Global
Categories, President of NIKE Direct, President Categories and Product, and the
President Jordan Brand â reviews and confirms all company-wide sustainability
policies and targets, reviews performance toward targets, receives updates on
key issues and emerging trends, and provides oversight for efforts to improve
data, transparency and disclosure.
** III. NIKEâS CODE OF CONDUCT AND STANDARDS TO ADDRESS FORCED LABOR **
NIKE takes seriously national and international efforts to end all kinds of
forced labor â whether in the form of prison labor, indentured labor, bonded
labor, human trafficking or otherwise.
NIKEâs requirements for suppliers are contained in our Code of Conduct and
Code Leadership Standards. The Code_of_Conduct lays out the required minimum
standards we expect each supplier factory or facility to meet in producing NIKE
products and includes strict requirements around forced and child labor,
excessive overtime, compensation, and freedom of association amongst other
requirements. The Code_Leadership_Standards specify how the Code of Conduct
must be implemented. The document also articulates how we measure factoriesâ
compliance efforts and progress against our Code of Conduct including specific
requirements on the management of key forced labor risks.
We have progressively raised expectations for our contract factories through
evolving standards of our Code of Conduct and Code Leadership Standards.
NIKEâs Code of Conduct and Code Leadership Standards include specific
requirements to address key risks of forced labor including, but not limited
to, prohibiting workers paying fees for employment, requiring terms and
conditions of employment to be provided and explained prior to departure from
the home country with adequate time for review, providing contracts in both the
workerâs language and legally enforceable language in the receiving country,
and prohibiting requirements to post bonds or make deposits as a condition of
employment.
** IV. DIRECT SUPPLIERS&#x27; CERTIFICATION OF MATERIALS **
NIKE requires its finished goods suppliers to verify they are sourcing
materials from vendors that are compliant with NIKE's Restricted Substances
List (RSL) and NIKEâs Code of Conduct. NIKE's Supply Agreements also
explicitly require suppliers to comply with all local and country-specific
labor laws and NIKEâs Code of Conduct and Code Leadership Standards.
** V. DUE DILIGENCE, RISK ASSESSMENT AND MONITORING **
RISK EVALUATION
NIKE continually evaluates and updates its systems to identify and address
risks in its supply chain, including those related to slavery and human
trafficking. This process includes information from external sources such as
risk assessments for key human rights risks, supplier specific risk profiling
based on location including the employment of vulnerable worker groups and
areas of improvement identified in audits. We also review information on key
and emerging risk areas identified through our engagement with external
stakeholders. NIKE is working towards mapping these risks further up the supply
chain and to expand engagement with Tier 2 suppliers where additional risks of
forced labor may occur.
In FY19, NIKE launched VeritÃ©âs CUMULUS Forced Labor Screenâ¢, a new due
diligence tool to help identify risks related to the recruitment of foreign
migrant workers by NIKE suppliers. NIKE is among the first adopters of the tool
during its limited release with our initial launch in Malaysia. In 2020, we
will continue to evaluate expansion to other high-risk countries.
Additionally, in FY19, NIKE began foreign migrant worker due diligence
assessments for both our Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers in Malaysia. We are
scaling to additional countries in FY20. The work aims to help us understand
current recruitment practices more deeply and map overlaps in recruitment
agents at both the facility and country level.
These steps will allow NIKE to identify opportunities to further support our
suppliers and their recruiting agents in implementing best practices.
AUDITING
We regularly audit contract factories, which are monitored on a schedule based
on their performance. These assessments take the form of audit visits, both
announced and unannounced to measure against the NIKE Code of Conduct, Code
Leadership Standards and local law.
NIKE uses both internal and external third-party audits to assess compliance
with our requirements and local law. We also monitor conditions at contract
factories through audits and assessments by independent organizations,
including the Fair Labor Association and the Better Work Programme, a joint
project of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and International
Finance Corporation (IFC). In FY19 we conducted 553 total audits and
assessments.
NIKE audits include detailed criteria to identify risks of forced labor or
human trafficking including the employment of vulnerable worker groups such as
foreign migrants, interns and temporary workers and high-risk practices such as
payment of recruitment fees or restrictions on freedom of movement.
** VI. REMEDIATION AND EFFECTIVENESS **
NIKE works with internal, external, and independent monitors to carry out
audits and help in remediation and capability-building efforts. If we are
alerted to an issue of non-compliance within one of our contract factories, we
investigate it immediately. Where improvements are required, we seek to drive
ownership by factory management to identify and correct issues, and also
improve systems to address root causes in order to prevent future
reoccurrences.
Working with a wide range of organizations and experts, NIKE continuously seeks
to improve our approach to evaluating working conditions in our supply chain
and working with our suppliers to enhance their capabilities.
For example, in FY18 we worked with a supplier to address issues, identified
through a NIKE audit, where foreign migrant workers paid fees related to their
employment in violation of NIKEâs Code of Conduct and Code Leadership
Standards. In FY19, we were alerted by a third party of its concerns that
recruitment fees at the facility were not fully remediated. Upon further
investigation, we coordinated with other buyers from the factory to help the
factory achieve full remediation. The process yielded key learnings which we
incorporated into capability-building for our current suppliers around labor
agent due diligence.
** VII. TRAINING AND ACCOUNTABILITY **
NIKE believes suppliers that prioritize the well-being of their workers, by
engaging with them to understand their needs, have better factory performance.
We also believe that our ability to influence suppliers is dependent, in part,
on how we build the right incentives and sanctions into our business
relationships. Our Manufacturing Index (MI), introduced in 2012, scores
factories on sustainability â including labor practices â on a par with
traditional metrics of cost, quality and on-time delivery.
To more fully integrate our sustainability criteria into sourcing decisions
NIKE provides required, annual training to those with direct responsibility for
supply chain management. The training advances enhanced understanding and
compliance with our sustainability policies and our Code of Conduct. The
training curriculum was updated in FY19 and includes a specific highlight on
our requirements to prevent risks of forced labor.
NIKE frequently convenes supplier events, or learning communities, designed to
share information on NIKE expectations, developments on local policies/
legislation, and other sustainability and labor best practices, including those
related to management of migrant workers, a challenge that is faced by many of
our suppliers and vendors in countries where it is common to recruit workers
cross-border. For example, suppliers in Thailand organized a learning community
event related to foreign migrant workers where they shared migrant management
processes prior to recruitment, applicable legal requirements, fee mapping
processes, and common challenges.
NIKE also organized supplier workshops in Malaysia and Taiwan during FY19,
where suppliers were trained on mapping forced labor risks related to
recruitment processes. In Malaysia, where the participants were largely Tier 1
suppliers and more mature in their management of foreign migrant workers, the
focus was on strengthening their due diligence processes in the sending
countries and differentiating those processes based on country of origin. In
Taiwan, where the participants were Tier 2 suppliers, they were introduced to a
management system framework to evaluate and improve their recruitment
practices. Those Tier 2 suppliers were also offered support in developing
improvement plans towards responsible recruitment, focused on successful
implementation of the Employer Pays Principle, a commitment that no worker
should pay for a job and the employer should pay the full costs of recruitment.
** VIII. COLLABORATIVE SOLUTIONS **
NIKE believes addressing critical human rights risks, such as forced labor,
often requires a collective approach. NIKE has long partnered with multi-
stakeholder and external organizations such as the Fair Labor Association,
Sustainable Apparel Coalition, the International Labour Organizationâs Better
Work Programme, and the Better Cotton Initiative to address labor risks in our
supply chain. Through our partnerships with these and other organizations we
work on a wide range of human rights risks, including those related to forced
labor and human trafficking.
In FY18 we joined a project facilitated by the FLA in partnership with Ä°yi
Pamuk Uygulamalari DerneÄi, as well as several other international brands, on
improving employment practices in the Turkish cotton sector. The project
focuses on preventing and addressing child labor risks and improving labor
recruitment practices at the farm level.
NIKE has also been involved with leading brands and retailers in Europe
developing an approach to supporting factories to recruit and manage a modern
day multinational workforce, with the aim to enable manufacturers and their
workers to adapt best practices in recruitment, integration and end of service.
We will continue to expand our collaboration with other peers, NGO,
organizations to increase respect for human rights and to accelerate positive
impact in the countries where we and our suppliers operate.
