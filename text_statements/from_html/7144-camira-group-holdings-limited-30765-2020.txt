** Our business **
As a global textile organisation, Camira offers turn-key products into the
commercial interior and mass passenger transportation markets. Our products
grace some of the most prestigious installations of blue-chip headquarters,
indoor arena and cinemas, healthcare facilities and education, and
transportation on mainline trains, underground trains, public buses and
coaches.

Headquartered in West Yorkshire (UK), Camira Group Holdings Limited continues
to lead a dynamic group of companies with its Board of Directors retaining
ultimate accountability for Group strategy, policy, governance and risk
management of modern slavery issues. Responsibility for the practical
implementation of modern slavery risk mitigation activity is undertaken by our
Human Resource, Strategic Purchasing, Sustainability and Compliance teams who
consult and work with nominated employee representatives, internationally,
nationally and locally.

See our Group_Compliance_Policy for more information.
** Our policy **
Underpinning our commitment to Making the Difference, we recognise our
potential to influence the safeguarding of our international, national and
local communities through our Corporate_Social_Responsibility_Policy. It is one
of our guiding principles to build and maintain the highest standards amongst
our suppliers and take practical steps to guard against exploitation of
workers, forced labour, harassment, intimidation and human trafficking.

Equally, Camira is focussed on providing a working environment in which our
People can thrive. Our suite of people-related strategies and policies ensure
that integrity is ingrained as a core value, and annual delivery of our
specialist modern slavery training validates our shared understanding of our
compliance culture.

It is the responsibility of all our People to adhere to the strategies,
policies and training provided, in addition to any specific local requirements.
Our strategies and policies are extended to our prospective supply chain
partners through our Supplier Assessment Framework and are made available
though our corporate website and intranet.
See our Group People Strategy, Equality & Diversity Policy & Health_&_Safety
Policy for more information.
** Our principal risks **
Our approach to identifying and assessing modern slavery risk is embedded
within our broader risk management practices. Businesses and functions governed
by this statement are contractually required to conform to Camira’s control
requirements including, active diligence in the identification and notification
of modern slavery risks. Our supply chain partners are additionally
contractually obligated to mitigate modern slavery risks with their supply
chain partners.

We have considered the exposure of Camira to modern slavery risk, taking into
account the nature of our business activities; the application of group
policies, particularly purchasing and recruitment practices.

Overall, we consider the Group’s exposure to Modern Slavery to be low.
** Tackling modern slavery risk in our supply chain **
The management of modern slavery risk and impact in our supply chain is
embedded into our Supplier Assessment Framework. Supported by our Strategic
Purchasing team, our supply chain is responsible for ensuring compliance with
local labour laws.

We assess the modern slavery risk to people in our supply chain by considering
the country of origin we are sourcing products and raw materials from. Our
Strategic Purchasing team develop expert knowledge of local labour laws and
human rights risks through stringent assessment and audit of potential supply
chain partners. The Camira Supplier Assessment Framework was introduced during
2018 with an achieved target of over 90% of total spend suppliers assessed.

Contractual obligations between Camira and its supply chain partners is now
mandated through our newly introduced Supplier Framework Agreement. Our
agreement places requirements on our suppliers to support the eradication of
modern slavery risks through the adherence with local legislation. During 2018
we have focussed on the implementation of the new agreements with our key
suppliers. Of our major suppliers instructed during 2018, four are now
contracted under our Supplier Framework Agreement.
** Tackling modern slavery risk in our business **
The management of modern slavery risk and impact in our business operations is
embedded into our recruitment processes. Supported by our Human Resource team,
our Leadership team is responsible for ensuring compliance with local labour
laws.

Introduced in 2018, all employees receive regular mandated training on ethical
behaviours. In particular, we provided modern slavery awareness training with
refresher training taking place annually in November. To date, 100% of
employees affecting our modern slavery risk exposure have undertaken our modern
slavery awareness training.

We encourage the raising of questions and concerns related to ethical business
practices. Besides operating an ‘open-door culture’ to encourage dialog between
our workers and Leadership team, our Whistleblowing Policy ensures people can
report any concerns in confidence. Concerns raised are reviewed by subject
matter experts within the Camira Group; we also seek external counsel when
required. To date no concerns have been raised related to modern slavery.
** Looking forward **
In the next 12 months we will continue to strengthen our approach to managing
the risk of modern slavery within our business.
    * Improvements to our Supplier Assessment Framework by introducing
      ‘weighted’ scores that proritise modern slavery issues;
    * Improvements to our Terms of Purchase to ensure all suppliers, no matter
      how big or small, are captured within our risk management framework;
    * Requirement that supply chain partners provide an annual Modern Slavery
      Statement pledging their continued commitment to the eradication of
      modern slavery.
    * Introduction of a Global Code of Conduct, for all our People, to ensure
      clear expectations about our approach to compliance and ethical issues;
    * Development of a Sustainability Roadmap, encompassing five distinct areas
      of improvement, including People, Culture and Communities;
    * Improved communication opportunities for our People to raise questions or
      concerns related to compliance and ethical issues.
