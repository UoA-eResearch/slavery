****** California Transparency in Supply Chain Act ******
**** July 15, 2015 ****
Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement Pursuant to the California Transparency
in Supply Chains Act The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010
(the “Act”) requires large manufacturers who do business in the State of
California and have gross worldwide sales of over $100 Million Dollars to be
transparent about their efforts to eradicate Slavery and Human Trafficking in
their supply Chain. Within the meaning of the Act, Slavery and Human
Trafficking concern the practice of utilizing forced or compulsory labor in any
work or service that is exacted from any person under the menace of any
penalty, and for which that person has not offered himself or herself
voluntarily. In accordance with the Act, this statement articulates our
policies and practices around recognizing and preventing human trafficking and
slavery in the global supply chain. 
We are members of the United Nations Global Compact. As such, we adhere to Ten
Principles (see https://www.unglobalcompact.org/AboutTheGC/TheTenPrinciples/
Principle4.html) which individually and collectively address our commitment to
human rights and the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor.
Our internal policies and practices, including our Guiding Principles and
Business Principles (available at http://www.freudenberg.com/en/Company/Values/
Pages/default.aspx ) are based on such principles of international labor and
human rights standards. Accordingly, we allow workers the right to freely
choose employment, the right to associate freely, the right to voluntarily join
or not join labor unions and bargain collectively, and the right to do so in a
workplace free of harassment and unlawful discrimination. Likewise, we seek
business partners that commit to observe such principles and human rights.
**** Verification ****
We adhere to all state and federal employment and labor laws. Accordingly, we
do not engage in the use of forced, bonded, indentured or involuntary labor and
do not tolerate our suppliers engaging in such conduct. We do not employ third
parties to verify supplier compliance. We verify supplier compliance by
insisting on it as part and parcel of our Purchase Terms and Conditions
(available at http://www.freudenberg-nw.com/en/Documents/FPMLP%20
(US)%20Universal%20PO%20FINAL%202015-03-23.pdf ).
**** Certification ****
As part of our contracting process, we require suppliers to certify that
neither they nor any of their subcontractors, vendors, agents or other
associated third parties utilize child, slave, prisoner or any other form of
forced or involuntary labor, or engage in abusive employment or corrupt
business practices, in the supply of products to our company (Compliance with
laws addendum, available at http://www.freudenberg-nw.com/en/Documents/FPMLP%20
(US)%20Universal%20PO%20FINAL%202015-03-23.pdf ).
**** Training  ****
We adhere to standards of responsible conduct and train employees to treat each
other with respect, and to adhere to laws, regulations and standards. We
maintain formal employment policies and standards under which there is no room
for forced or compulsory labor in any work or service. Our policies and
standards are monitored by the Human Resources department, which has discretion
to discipline employees up to and including termination. We make available to
employees and suppliers Q&A information (Appendix A hereto) which enables them
to recognize forbidden conduct and encourages them to report it for appropriate
corrective action.
**** Audit  ****
We are vigilant of any conduct that violates company policies or principles. We
do not engage external auditors in connection with the California Transparency
in Supply Chains Act. As part of our policies and standards, we encourage
persons who witness offensive conduct to bring it to the attention of the
offending party and to Human Resources. All reports of offensive conduct are
investigated and subjected to appropriate corrective action.
**** Internal Accountability  ****
We rely on voluntary reports of non-compliance and take them seriously. In
addition to relying on legally mandated posters which advise workers of their
rights, employees are also informed of their right to lodge internal complaints
without fear of retaliation. After investigation, non-compliance of any
employment or labor standards can result in corrective action up to and
including termination. Further, noncompliance by suppliers can result in
termination of the relationship when a supplier that does not comply fails to
commit to a specific plan to achieve compliance.
Appendix A - Q & A on Slavery and Human Trafficking: What Does it Mean and What
to Do About it? 
There are numerous laws that forbid Slavery and Human Trafficking. As a
signatory of the UN Global Compact, our company does not engage in Slavery and
Human Trafficking and does not associate with suppliers that engage in such
conduct. 
What does Slavery and Human Trafficking Mean in the Twenty-First Century?
Slavery and Human Trafficking concern the practice of utilizing forced or
compulsory labor in any work or service that is exacted from any person under
the menace of any penalty, and for which that person has not offered himself or
herself voluntarily. Providing wages or other compensation to a worker does not
necessarily indicate that the labor is not forced or compulsory. By right,
labor should be freely given and employees should be free to leave in
accordance with established rules. While forced or compulsory labor can present
itself in many forms, in our global manufacturing business, examples of conduct
which may amount to forced or compulsory labor are:
    * Child labor in particularly abusive conditions where the child has no
      choice about whether to work
    * Physical abduction or kidnapping
    * Sale of a person into the ownership of another Physical confinement in
      the work location (in prison or in private detention)
    * The work or service of prisoners if they are hired to or placed at the
      disposal of private individuals, companies or associations involuntarily
      and without supervision of public authorities
    * Requiring the indefinite lodging of deposits, financial, or personal
      documents as condition to employment
    * Destroying, confiscating or denying access to an employee’s identity
      documents, such as passports or drivers’ licenses
    * Charging employees (as opposed to employers) recruitment fees as a
      condition for securing employment
    * Physical or psychological (including sexual) violence as a means of
      keeping someone in forced labor (direct or as a threat against worker,
      family, or close associates)
    * Full or partial restrictions on freedom of movement
    * Withholding and non-payment of wages (linked to manipulated debt
      payments, exploitation, and other forms of extortion)
    * Deprivation of food, shelter or other necessities
    * Deception or false promises about terms and types of work
    * Induced indebtedness (by falsification of accounts, charging inflated
      prices, reduced value of goods or services produced, excessive interest
      charges, etc.), and
    * Threats to denounce workers in an irregular situation to the authorities
Associates, contractors, and suppliers aware of any such conduct should report
it to HR or the Legal Department. Consistent with company policy, the company
forbids retaliation against any employee who reports or assists in an
investigation of unlawful conduct, including Slavery and Human Trafficking.
Employees who believe they have been the subject of retaliation should follow
the company’s internal complaint mechanism for reporting retaliation.
