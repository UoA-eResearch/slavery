MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT
INTRODUCTION FROM THE GROUP CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
Quantum Clothing Group Ltd takes its commitments under the Modern Slavery Act
very seriously. As a company we are committed to conducting business in a
lawful, ethical and responsible manner, and expect our supply chain partners to
share this commitment. Modern slavery and human trafficking are hidden,
pervasive crimes, and we all have the responsibility to drive them out of our
industry.
QUANTUM CLOTHING GROUP LTD STRUCTURE AND SUPPLY CHAIN
Quantum Clothing Group Ltd are a major supplier to the leading high street
retailers in the UK and Europe. The Company was founded in 2000 and is a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Itochu Corporation. The Itochu Corporation is
headquartered in Japan.
Quantum Clothing Group Ltd has a UK Head Office covering Design, Development
and Commercial activities and owned manufacturing sites in Cambodia and Sri
Lanka employing over 5000 employees. We also source products from key
manufacturing partners in Asia, including Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, China
and India.
OUR POLICY ON SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
Quantum Clothing Group Ltd is committed to ensuring that there is no modern
slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or any part of our business.
All employees are expected to work within the requirements of the company
Policies and Procedures, as well as the Itochu Group Compliance Policy which is
located on the internal intranet site. Itochu respects the laws and regulations
of the countries where it does business and international rules, and will
pursue the highest standards of ethical behavior in its dealings with
customers, suppliers, employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders.
We operate an audit program that ensures that our suppliers are monitored
against our Ethical Code of Conduct, aligned to the ETI Base Code, which
includes, among other requirements, conditions whereby factories producing our
goods must ensure that employment is freely chosen, child labour shall not be
used, and no harsh or inhumane treatment will occur.
DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk we use a mixture of
announced and unannounced, internal, second and third party auditing through
our supply chain, which is published on the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange
(Sedex). Audit data forms the basis of risk assessments to identify areas of
potential risk in our supply chain. Where potential risks are identified, a
remediation plan is developed to best address them.
Compliance staff in region make themselves aware of any potential issues by
interviewing workers, gaining their trust, and learning over time which agents
and factories have good or bad reputations and practices. In cases where issues
are found they will work resolutely with factory management to resolve them.
Contained within our Company Whistleblowing Policy, we have in place systems to
encourage the reporting of concerns and the protection of whistleblowers.
Additionally, all employees have the option to report concerns confidentially
through the mechanism of the Itochu Group Compliance Policy.
TRAINING
As part of our induction process, all new staff receive information to ensure
understanding of the Quantum Clothing Group Ltd Company Policies and
Procedures, and the Itochu Group Compliance Policy. All company policies are
accessible on the company intranet for ease of reference.
