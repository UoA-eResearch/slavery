CALIFORNIA_TRANSPARENCY_IN_SUPPLY_CHAINS_ACT
The Rockport Company, LLC (“Rockport”) values its strong reputation for honesty
and integrity throughout the industry. Guided by a commitment to maintain our
high standards and ethical conduct in our business practices, the workplace and
the environment, we expect our employees, business partners and suppliers to
conduct all business activities in a responsible and ethical manner.
We are committed to ensuring that the guidelines embodied in our “ENGAGEMENT
CRITERIA FOR SOURCES, VENDORS & OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS” are followed by our
employees, suppliers, and business partners, in all global locations where our
portfolio of brands are produced or sold. We expect our suppliers and business
partners to comply with these standards while enforcing these same standards
throughout their supply chain. We will monitor activities through on-site
inspections, signed manufacturing agreements, and third party assessments. We
favor partners who contribute to the betterment of the communities in which
they operate.
***** Verification of Supply Chain: *****
Potential factories are evaluated before becoming an approved Rockport factory
to assess risks related to Health & Safety, Environment, Employment Practices,
Freedom of Association and Security Standards. We perform this evaluation with
third party audits of the facility and work environment. Once approved,
factories must commit contractually to meet the standards set by our ENGAGEMENT
CRITERIA FOR SOURCES, VENDORS & OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS or be subject to
restriction or termination of their contractual relationship with us. No
production of Rockport products may take place in a factory until an audit has
been completed and an agreement has been signed.
***** Supplier Audits: *****
Rockport reserves the right to verify a supplier’s compliance with the
ENGAGEMENT CRITERIA FOR SOURCES, VENDORS & OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS through
third party audits or onsite inspections including interviews with a supplier’s
employees in order to evaluate compliance with standards for employment, wages,
child labor, human trafficking and slavery, among others. If we become aware of
any action or condition that is not compliant with our standards, we demand
immediate corrective actions. Rockport reserves the right to terminate any
supplier who does not comply with our standards.
***** Certification of Materials: *****
Rockport expects all suppliers to certify their compliance with our standards
and that they have enforced those standards throughout their supply chain.
Suppliers must also certify that the materials incorporated into Rockport
products comply with all laws, including those regarding human trafficking,
child labor and slavery of the country or countries in which the supplier is
doing business.
***** Internal Accountability of Standards: *****
Rockport expects its employees, suppliers and business partners to comply with
its Code of Conduct and ENGAGEMENT CRITERIA FOR SOURCES, VENDORS & OTHER
BUSINESS PARTNERS. We expect our employees to uphold and live our commitment to
high standards and ethical conduct in their day-to-day responsibilities.
***** Employee and Management Training: *****
All Rockport employees receive annual training on our Code of Conduct which
requires compliance with laws and our policies including our ENGAGEMENT
CRITERIA FOR SOURCES, VENDORS & OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS, with a focus on
mitigating risks.
