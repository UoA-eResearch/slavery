****** SUPPLY CHAIN DISCLOSURE ******
***** California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and UK Modern Slavery Act
Disclosure *****
TOMS’ mission to help improve lives through business is a core value and is
embedded in everything we do. We believe in partnering with others who share
these values and who conduct business ethically.
This Statement relates to our fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (“fiscal
2018”). This Statement describes the activities of TOMS SHOES, LLC and its
consolidated subsidiaries (collectively “TOMS,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”).
We distribute our products in over 70 countries and most of our consolidated
subsidiaries are not subject to the California Transparency in Supply Chains
Act or the UK Modern Slavery Act. We have prepared this Statement on a
consolidated basis because we employ the same policies and compliance program
relating to anti-human trafficking and forced labor (sometimes referred to
herein as “modern slavery”) across our entire business.
Business Overview
TOMS is a global footwear and lifestyle brand committed to helping humanity
thrive. At the end of fiscal 2018, we had approximately 469 total employees,
consisting of approximately 350 full-time employees and approximately119 part-
time employees, with approximately 248 of our employees engaged in retail
selling and administrative positions, and the remaining employees engaged in
other aspects of the Company's business. As of the end of fiscal 2018, most of
the Company's employees were located in the Americas (primarily in the United
States), with the remainder located in Europe and Asia. Our commercial
manufacturing base, which consists of third-party contractors, is located
mostly in China and Vietnam.
TOMS takes seriously the global efforts to end all kinds of forced labor,
whether in the form of prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor, human
trafficking or otherwise. At TOMS, we believe we have a responsibility to
conduct our business in an ethical way. We expect the same from our business
partners, and focus on working with long-term, strategic suppliers that
demonstrate a commitment to engaging with their workers and ensuring safe
working conditions and environmental responsibility.
From day one TOMS has been committed to using business to improve lives. In
partnership with customers and giving partners TOMS has impacted over
94,000,000 lives through our shoe, sight and water giving. Since 2006, TOMS has
worked with over 90 non-governmental, international humanitarian and social
enterprise organizations in over 90 countries. TOMS currently helps give shoes,
build vision centers and sustainable water systems that will support
underserved communities for generations to come. To date, TOMS has helped give
over 93 million new pairs of shoes, 770,000 sight restorations, 730,000 weeks
of safe water and committed over $6.5M in impact grants. TOMS works closely
with our giving partners to determine how our giving can add the most value to
both the community and individual beneficiary. Our shoes, sight and water
giving partners are focused on education, health, relief and empowerment.
Through our expanding giving strategy, our impact grants partners are currently
focused on mental health, ending gun violence, equality, homelessness and
women’s rights.
In 2013, TOMS committed to producing one-third of our giving shoes in the
regions where we give them. We believe local production helps build industry,
create jobs and build sustainable futures. Today, we are proud to manufacture
all of our giving shoes in regions where we give.

Risks of Slavery and Human Trafficking in Our Supply Chain
We believe that the risk of modern slavery in our own business is minimal,
given our internal procedures. Our compliance efforts are therefore focused on
our supply chain. TOMS has established the compliance and other procedures
discussed in this Statement to mitigate the risks of slavery and human
trafficking in our supply chains for our products.
We focus primarily on our direct factory suppliers, since this is the level of
the supply chain where we believe that we have the most influence and can
therefore be the most effective. We expect our suppliers will uphold the same
values that are associated with TOMS, i.e., improving lives through business.
We recognize the need to continually evaluate the effectiveness of our
operating procedures relating to modern slavery to confirm compliance with
laws, disclose legally mandated and/or voluntary information and, most
importantly, ensure that effective preventive mechanisms are in place.
Transparency in our Supply Chain:
Transparency in the manufacturing supply chain better enables TOMS to
collaborate with civil societies and other organizations to identify, assess,
and avoid actual or potential adverse human rights impacts. TOMS commits to
publishing finished goods supplier factory information to help assert workers’
human rights, advance ethical business practices and human rights due diligence
in the apparel and footwear supply chains, in line with the United Nations
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Please_see_our_supplier_list
here.
Policies and Contractual Terms and Conditions
We have a Code of Business Practices (the “Employee Code”) that sets forth the
standard of conduct that is to govern the actions of every employee of TOMS. In
addition to indicating that employees must respect and obey the laws, the
Employee Code indicates that we are committed to a work environment in which
all individuals are treated with respect; that we prohibit discriminatory
practices; and that we are committed to providing a safe, healthy and
comfortable workplace for all employees. New employees are provided with a copy
of the Employee Code upon hire, which each employee must sign and acknowledge.
A copy of the Employee Code is also available on the TOMS Intranet. Failure to
comply with the Code may result in corrective action up to and including
termination of employment with the Company. For a copy of the Employee Code,
please_click_here.
We also require all suppliers to adhere to the Supplier Code (the “Supplier
Code”) when producing TOMS merchandise. The Supplier Code is a statement of
values and expectations meant to guide decisions in factories where TOMS shoes
are manufactured and addresses topics such as child labor, forced labor,
excessive overtime, legal wages, discrimination, harassment-free workplace
policies and freedom of association. We evaluate potential contracted factories
against our Supplier Code standards and require them to agree in writing to
these standards prior to entering our supply chain. –We have progressively
raised the expectations of our factory partners through the evolving standards
of our Supplier Code of Conduct. The_Supplier_Code_can_be_viewed_here.
Our mechanisms for reporting violations of our Employee Code and Supplier Code
and other grievances are discussed below under “Internal Accountability and
Training.”
Our supplier contracts provide that contracted factories must conduct business
in full compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and comply
with the terms of the Supplier Code. In addition, these contracts specifically
forbid the use of forced labor and prohibit discrimination or harassment in the
workplace. Each factory is required to certify compliance with these terms and
conditions prior to becoming an approved contracted factory.
In addition, to mitigate the risks of slavery and human trafficking at indirect
suppliers, TOMS prohibits contracted factories from engaging subcontractors
without the written permission of TOMS and a subsequent audit of the facility.
Verification of Product Supply Chains to Address and Evaluate Risks of Human
Trafficking and Slavery
When assessing the risks of modern slavery at any one factory, we take into
account various factors, including the factory’s geographic location(s) and the
nature of its manufacturing activities for TOMS (including consideration of the
anticipated output). As part of our risk assessment, we also conduct
preliminary inspections of each new factory’s facility and require detailed
questionnaires from potential factories.
Audits
TOMS audits 100% of finished-goods factories (Tier 1 of the supply chain) for
social and environmental concerns. Audits are performed through our internal
CSR audit team, a third-party monitoring firm or–to reduce audit fatigue in
factories–co-audit with other brands or obtain recent audit reports from a
credible source. TOMS also monitors its raw-material suppliers (Tier 2 of the
supply chain) and employs an audit and remediation process at these facilities
similar to those in Tier 1 factories.
Before conducting business with TOMS, each factory must undergo an unannounced
factory audit. Our on-site process includes audits by our trained factory
compliance auditors and third-party audit companies. Issues such as health and
safety, wage and compliance, forced labor, child labor issues, harassment-free
workplace policies, and environmental issues are reviewed. The entire factory,
including dormitories, if applicable, is audited. The auditors will interview
groups of employees, as well as individuals, without management presence, to
allow them to freely comment on their work conditions. Commencing in 2017,
anonymous factory employee surveys have been included as part of our audit
process to increase transparency within our supply chain.
Audits also are performed annually and scored on a graded scale. To receive an
“accepted” rating, a factory must not have any serious health, safety or labor
issues in its facility. A factory receiving an “accepted” rating is authorized
to produce TOMS products for one year, at which time it must again undergo an
annual review and full audit. A factory receiving a “Needs Improvement” rating
may still produce our products, but is audited again within six to nine months
and must show continuous improvement in health, safety, and labor issues.
Factories with a lower rating are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The CSR
compliance team will work with factories receiving a “Needs Improvement” or
lower rating to build a Corrective Action Plan and address the issues in a
proactive manner. A factory with persistent safety, health, or labor issues
that fails to remediate these issues in an acceptable manner will be rejected
as our supplier and will not be authorized to supply products for TOMS.
Auditing our suppliers helps to bring accountability and deliver credibility to
the supply chain by providing a verification point and by helping us to
understand the overall direction of improvement. However, audits are not an end
in themselves, providing only a snapshot in time, and we believe work best as
part of a broader approach to engagement, collaboration and continuous
improvement.
Internal Accountability and Training
TOMS has a zero tolerance policy for violations involving any form of modern
slavery. Vendors or factories found to be in violation of this policy will be
immediately terminated. Our CSR compliance team works closely with our senior
leadership and General Counsel to help ensure that our suppliers follow our
Supplier Code.
TOMS conducts annual global compliance training with its employees and the
management teams of its key factories, focusing on monitoring the risk for
modern slavery and adherence to the Supplier Code. TOMS’ supply chain employees
meet regularly with factories and key suppliers to reiterate TOMS' zero
tolerance policy for suppliers who engage in modern slavery. They are also
encouraged to utilize a compliance checklist when visiting factories, which
helps to identify any issues which may require correction. Suppliers have been
informed that they must make every effort possible to ensure that workers in
their factories are employed at their free will. Any supplier found in
violation of this policy will be terminated. TOMS takes issues involving human
rights seriously and we expect our suppliers to do their best to ensure that
forced labor in any form is not used in the production of our goods. We will
continue to evaluate and update our policies and procedures as needed to make
certain that the appropriate safeguards are in place to prevent any
mistreatment of persons involved in our supply chain.
Additionally, our employees are encouraged to raise any concerns they may have
about human rights issues and they have multiple channels to do so, including
through a confidential mail box in each office and an email address
(social_compliance@toms.com) that goes directly to our SVP and General Counsel/
HR, as well as the CSR management team. All complaints are confidential but
reporting anonymously could limit TOMS ability to collect relevant information
about the concern.
This Statement has been approved and signed as required by the UK Modern
Slavery Act.
