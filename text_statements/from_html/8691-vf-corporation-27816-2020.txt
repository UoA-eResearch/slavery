****** CA Supply Chains Act ******
At VF, our core values of honesty, integrity and respect are embedded in
everything we do. We believe in partnering with others who share our values and
who understand the importance of always conducting business ethically.
We are committed to taking steps to end forced labor, whether in the form of
human trafficking, indentured labor, prison labor or otherwise. This statement
outlines many of our efforts to eradicate forced labor from our direct supply
chains.
***** Verification *****
At VF, we hold our contracted factories to the same high standards of social
and environmental responsibility found in our own facilities. We evaluate
potential contracted factories against our rigorous standards and require them
to agree to VFâs_Terms_of_Engagement prior to entering our supply chain. By
agreeing to our Terms of Engagement, contracted factories are also bound by
VF's_Global_Compliance_Principles. These Principles address topics such as
child labor, forced labor, legal wages, discrimination, and harassment-free
workplace policies. They also prohibit contracted factories from engaging
subcontractors to produce VF products without the written permission of VF.
At VF, we will not knowingly work with factories that use forced labor. We use
our own trained factory compliance auditors as well as accredited third-party
auditors to ensure compliance with our Terms of Engagement.
***** Audits *****
Before conducting business with VF, each factory must undergo a rigorous
Factory_Compliance_Audit. Our on-site audit process includes scheduled and
unannounced audits by our trained factory compliance auditors and third-party
audit companies. We inspect for evidence of health and safety concerns, wage
and social compliance, forced labor, child labor issues, harassment-free
workplace policies, and environmental issues. To receive an âacceptedâ
rating, a factory must not have any serious health, safety or labor issues in
its facility. A factory receiving an accepted rating is authorized to produce
our products for one year, at which time it must undergo an annual review. A
factory receiving a âdevelopmentalâ rating may still produce our products,
but is audited again within six to nine months and must show continuous
improvement in health, safety, and labor issues. A factory with persistent
safety, health, or labor issues that fails to remediate issues within 180 days
will be rejected as our supplier and unauthorized to supply product for VF.
***** Certification *****
Our Terms of Engagement make it clear that contracted factories must conduct
business in full compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and
comply with the terms of our Global Compliance Principles. The Principles
specifically forbid the use of forced labor and prohibit discrimination or
harassment in the workplace. Each factory certifies compliance with these terms
and conditions prior to becoming an approved contracted factory.
***** Accountability *****
All VF associates must comply with our Code_of_Business_Conduct, which includes
principles relating to human trafficking and forced labor. Violation of our
Code of Business Conduct by one of our associates can result in disciplinary
action, including termination of employment. Consistent with internationally
recognized labor standards, our Global Compliance Principles specify minimum
working conditions for employees of our suppliers, helping to ensure that
wherever our products are produced, each and every product reflects our values.
A contracted factoryâs breach of the Terms of Engagement can result in VF
taking corrective action, including termination as an approved contracted
factory.
All VF-owned and operated factories also undergo independent certification by
Worldwide_Responsible_Accredited_Production (âWRAPâ), a non-profit
organization that promotes global ethics in manufacturing.
***** Training *****
VF associates complete online and facilitator-led training on our Code of
Business Conduct and sign an agreement to abide by its principles, including
those related to human trafficking and forced labor. For our associates and
management who have direct responsibility for monitoring, auditing and
enforcing our Global Compliance Principles, we provide additional training
conducted by our staff or a third-party. Training includes topics such as
identifying child labor, involuntary or forced labor and preventing human
trafficking.
