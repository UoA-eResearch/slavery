****** Supply Chain Act ******
CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN ACT
Vince Holding Corp. and its subsidiaries has built its brand around the
consistent production of high quality products, from apparel to accessories,
and its commitment to conducting business according to the highest ethical and
legal standards. 

Among other things, we require all factories and suppliers to adhere to our
code of conduct, which set forth our business, legal and ethical standards in
the following areas: occupational health and safety, work hours, transparent
record keeping practices, wages and benefits, freedom of association, customs
compliance, product safety, environmental safekeeping and prohibitions on child
labor, forced labor, prison labor, discrimination, and harassment. 

To eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our supply chain, we:
   1. verify product supply chains using third party auditors to ensure that
      our product supply chains are compliant with our code of conduct and all
      applicable laws and regulations prohibiting slave labor and human
      trafficking;
   2. conduct independent audits of our suppliers to evaluate their compliance
      with our code of conduct and all applicable laws and regulations
      prohibiting slave labor and human trafficking;
   3. require certification by our suppliers that their services comply with
      our code of conduct and all with applicable laws and regulations
      prohibiting slave labor and human trafficking in countries where our
      suppliers are doing business;
   4. maintain internal accountability standards and procedures for employees
      and contractors failing to abide by our code of conduct prohibiting slave
      labor and human trafficking; and
   5. provide training for our supply chain executives and employees on the
      prevention of human trafficking and slave labor.
