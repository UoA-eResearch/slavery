****** Transparency in Supply Chains Statement. ******
Centric Brands Inc. is committed to the highest ethical principles and
standards and legal compliance in all aspects of our business and product
supply chain. We choose suppliers who we believe share that commitment.
We take the risks of slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain very
seriously. Like many companies manufacturing or selling products in California,
we are required to comply with the California Transparency in Supply Chains
Act. This law was designed to increase the amount of information available to
consumers about the efforts of businesses to eliminate the risk of modern
slavery, human trafficking and similar human rights violations from their
product supply chains. Throughout this disclosure, we use the terms "slavery"
and "human trafficking" as examples of the many forms of involuntary labor
described by the International Labour Organization, all of which are prohibited
under our requirements for suppliers and other manufacturing partners.
COMPANY OVERVIEW. Centric Brands Inc. is a leading lifestyle brands collective
created by the acquisition in October 2018 by Centric Brands Inc. (formerly
known as Differential Brands Group Inc.) of a significant part of Global Brands
Group Holding Limitedâs North American licensing business. Centric Brands
brings together creative minds from the worlds of fashion and commerce,
sourcing, technology, marketing, digital and entertainment. We design, produce,
merchandise, manage, market and manufacture through contract supply chain
partners, kidswear, accessories, and womenâs and menâs apparel under owned,
licensed and private label brands. We distribute our products across all retail
and digital channels in North America and in international markets.
We license over 100 brands and produce branded or private label products across
our core product categories. We sell our products through a cross section of
leading retailers, over the web through retail partners and through our own
retail stores, e- commerce websites and partner shop-in-shops. We employ
approximately 4,000 employees primarily in offices in New York City,
Greensboro, Los Angeles, Toronto and Montreal, and in retail stores throughout
North America.
VERIFICATION OF SUPPLY CHAIN. To determine which sourcing countries and sectors
pose a risk of slavery or human trafficking, we utilize several publicly-
available governmental and intergovernmental resources, including the U.S.
State Departmentâs annual Trafficking in Persons Report and the U.S.
Department of Laborâs List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor.
We continuously reassess our approach as these resources are updated and new,
credible resources emerge. In addition, we are a member of the American Apparel
& Footwear Association, a leading industry association which provides tools and
actionable guidance to its members for the protection of workersâ rights,
including the prevention of slavery and human trafficking.
FACTORY AUDITS. We conduct audits of our direct suppliers to evaluate
compliance with our Global Supplier Principles, which include prohibitions on
slavery and human trafficking. We utilize unaffiliated third-party workplace
compliance audit firms to execute announced and unannounced audits. We collect
initial audit information for all new suppliers. To determine factory selection
and timing for audits thereafter, we look at several criteria, including past
compliance performance, if available, to determine risk and audit priority.
Suppliers identified as high risk through the assessment process undergo more
frequent monitoring to ensure continuous progress is made toward compliance.
SUPPLIER CERTIFICATION. At the inception of our business relationship and
annually thereafter, all of our suppliers must certify receipt, review and
understanding of the Centric Brands Inc. Global Supplier Principles and Centric
Brands Inc. Involuntary Labor Policy. Among other requirements, these standards
prohibit the use of any form of involuntary labor, including child, forced,
bonded, trafficked, indentured or prison labor, prohibit the purchase of
materials from persons or entities utilizing any such labor, and prohibit
subcontracting without our prior written approval. In addition, we require all
direct suppliers to comply with applicable laws regarding slavery and human
trafficking within their countries of operation.
ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES. We also maintain strong internal
accountability procedures, which are communicated through our Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics (the âCodeâ). Under the Code, our employees are required
to follow our commitment to the highest ethical standards and the law in all
their business dealings and to report any violations or suspected violations of
the law or the Code. Compliance with the Code is a condition of employment, and
failure to abide by these terms can result in any corrective action we deem
necessary, which may include notifying appropriate authorities and/or imposing
disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
Our employees who regularly visit suppliers are asked to assess conditions
informally while on location and report any concerns. Our compliance and
sourcing teams meet regularly to review supplier compliance performance and
develop strategies to help suppliers improve compliance. In cases of non-
compliance, we examine the specific situation and support our suppliers in
developing an appropriate strategy for timely resolution, which may include a
formal corrective action plan. A supplierâs failure to successfully remediate
the non-compliance may result in termination of our business relationship with
the supplier.
TRAINING. We plan to provide training in 2019 to employees with direct
responsibility for supply chain management to ensure they are knowledgeable and
aware of the issues and concerns surrounding slavery and human trafficking.
This training will focus specifically on recognizing and preventing forced
labor risks within our supply chain. We encourage our agents and suppliers to
participate in seminars and training programs on compliance issues, including
slavery and human trafficking, to increase their awareness of best practices to
mitigate risk within our supply chain.
