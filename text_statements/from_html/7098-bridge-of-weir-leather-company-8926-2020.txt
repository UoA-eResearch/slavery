**** SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT ****

**** Introduction from the Managing Director ****
Slavery and human trafficking remains a hidden blight on our global society. We
all have a responsibility to be alert to the risks, however small, in our
business and in the wider supply chain. Staff are expected to report concerns
and management are expected to act upon them.
**** Our Business ****
Bridge of Weir Leather Company is a privately owned UK based leather
manufacturer supplying leather to the global automotive industry.

Scottish Leather Group Limited is the parent company of Bridge of Weir Leather
Company. Scottish Leather Group comprises of four leather manufacturing
subsidiaries and a technology company; Andrew Muirhead & Son Limited, Bridge of
Weir Leather Company Limited, W. J. and W. Lang Limited, NCT Leather Limited
and SLG Technology Limited.

We have zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. We expect all those in
our supply chain and contractors to comply with our values.

All directors are responsible for compliance in their respective areas of
responsibility and for their supplier relationships.
**** Training ****
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and
human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, we provide training to
relevant members of staff. All directors have been briefed on the subject.

**** Our Effectiveness In Combating Slavery and Human Trafficking ****
We use the following key performance indicators (KPI’s) to measure how
effective we have been to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not
taking place in any part of our business or supply chains:

Completion of business unit audits by directors and senior managers.

Use of labour monitoring and payroll systems; and

Level of communication and personal contact with the next link in the supply
chains and their understanding of, and compliance with, our expectations.

This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015
and constitutes our group’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the
current financial year.

**** CONFLICT MINERAL POLICY STATEMENT ****

**** Background ****
 
Scottish Leather Group does not use Conflict Minerals in the production of its
leather. There are global concerns that proceeds from the mining, trade and
sale of conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold) are being used to
directly or indirectly finance armed conflict and violence in the Democratic
Republic of Congo and several adjoining countries (the “DRC Region”).1 In an
effort to curb the violence, a portion of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) required the
Securities and Exchange Commission (”SEC”) to issue rules relating to the use
of conflict minerals or “3TG” within manufactured products. In August 2012, the
SEC issued a final rule implementing the “conflict minerals” disclosure
requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “SEC Conflict Minerals Reporting
Rule”). If an SEC registrant manufactures (or contracts to manufacture)
commercial products containing “3TG” that are necessary to the products’
functionality or production, the Rule requires that company to determine the
origin and status of those minerals.2
**** Our Commitment ****

Scottish Leather Group is committed to conducting its business worldwide with
respect for human rights and in compliance with all applicable laws, as
evidenced by Our Vision, Mission and Values. To that end, Scottish Leather
Group is taking steps to determine the origin of any 3TG that may be necessary
to its products’ functionality or production.3 Scottish Leather Group will work
closely with its supply chain partners and will seek, over time, to identify,
reduce and eliminate the use in its products of conflict minerals that
originate in the DRC Region and support armed conflict or violence.
**** Our Expectations ****

Scottish Leather Group expects its suppliers to partner it to comply with the
reporting requirements set forth in the SEC Conflict Minerals Reporting Rule.
Specifically, Scottish Leather Group expects that its suppliers will:
 
   1. Work with their own upstream suppliers to identify the chain of custody
      for any conflict minerals (including the smelter, country of origin, mine
      location and status of any conflict minerals that may be present);
   2.
   3. Cooperate with Scottish Leather Group in connection with any due
      diligence (or additional due diligence) that Scottish Leather Group
      chooses to perform with respect to its country of origin inquiries;
   4.
   5. Provide, upon request by Scottish Leather Group, reasonable proof of the
      due diligence performed by the supplier to support any country of origin/
      sourcing certification provided to Scottish Leather Group; and
   6.
   7. As needed, assist Scottish Leather Group to identify opportunities to
      source DRC conflict mineral-free materials.
   8.
 
 
 
1 ”Conflict Minerals” or “3TG” are defined in Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank
Act as columbite-tantalite (the ore from which tantalum is derived),
cassiterite (the ore from which tin is derived), wolframite (the ore from which
tungsten is derived) and gold.
2 Specifically, companies must determine whether: (i) any “conflict minerals”
that are necessary to the functionality or production of a product originated
in the covered countries; and (ii) whether the minerals directly or indirectly
finance or benefit armed groups in the covered countries.
3 The due diligence process being followed by Scottish Leather Group is in
material conformance with the current edition of the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible
Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas and
accompanying supplements.
