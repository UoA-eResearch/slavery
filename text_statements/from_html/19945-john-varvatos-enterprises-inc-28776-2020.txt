California Transparency in Supply Chains Act Disclosure
John Varvatos Enterprises, Inc. (“John Varvatos”) is committed to conducting
business according to the highest ethical and legal standards. We operate under
a Code of Business Conduct, which sets forth the key principles under which our
company and our worldwide affiliates are required to operate.
John Varvatos also supports the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of
2010 (SB 657) (the “CA Transparency Act”), which requires companies to disclose
their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct
supply chains. We work hard to choose reputable business partners who operate
in strict compliance with the California Transparency Act and who are committed
to a set of ethical standards and business practices that are compatible with
our Code of Business Conduct.
We require all of our manufacturers, contractors, suppliers, licensees and
agents to comply with our Terms of Engagement and Global Compliance Principles
(the “Principles”) and to verify that any subcontractors they use in connection
with John Varvatos products also comply with the Principles. These Principles
include ethical labor standards which prohibit the use of involuntary or forced
labor, indentured, bonded or otherwise, among other unethical labor practices.
We require each factory to maintain documentation necessary to demonstrate
compliance with the Principles, and to grant us access to all records,
including confidential interviews with employees. The Principles require each
factory to create an informed workplace, by educating employees, and
communications and prominent posting of the standards, translated into the
language of the employees, throughout the workplace.
We engage in verification of our product supply chains, by both internal and
third-party auditors, to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and
slavery. Our suppliers are cleared and vetted prior to selection. We are
dedicated to improving workplaces around the globe, and ensuring informed,
ethical business transactions. To that end, we participate in an industry-wide
shared database of factories committed to our values and principles, the Fair
Factories_Clearinghouse.
We conduct internal audits of our suppliers to evaluate their compliance with
our Principles, including our company standards against trafficking and slavery
in supply chains. In addition, we retain multiple third party audit companies
to assist us in meeting our goal of auditing each facility in our direct supply
chain. Most of the audits are announced. A small percentage of the audits are
unannounced. We provide audit results to factory managers who are required to
sign and acknowledge them at the time of the audit. We require our suppliers to
correct any problems identified by the audit, or face termination. Certain
audit findings, such as the use of child labor, result in the immediate
termination of that supplier with no opportunity to correct.
We require all of our suppliers, manufacturers, subcontractors, licensees and
facilities that produce goods for John Varvatos to certify that they will not
use involuntary or forced labor in the production of our products (or
components thereof) and that they will take steps to prevent practices that
could contribute to human trafficking.
We maintain internal accountability standards and procedures for employees and
contractors failing to meet these standards regarding slavery and trafficking.
We require all officers and employees of our company to adhere to our Code of
Business Conduct. We provide each officer and employee is provided a copy of
the Code of Conduct and asked to read it, understand it and follow it in their
daily activities. Employees must sign an acknowledgement form that they have
read the Code and certify and affirm that they will adhere to the Code. We
conduct joint training with our buying agents and our direct factory suppliers
in all our jurisdictions annually. We plan to include in our annual employee
training program for all employees with supply chain responsibilities training
with respect to mitigating the risk of human trafficking and slavery within the
supply chain.
To ensure compliance with our Principles, we require facilities to maintain
onsite all documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance with our
Principles. We also require our manufacturers and direct suppliers to certify
that they have in effect a program of monitoring their subcontractors to verify
and ensure their compliance with these Principles. It is our policy to monitor
every facility that is involved in the manufacture of a John Varvatos branded
product, including apparel, non-apparel, cutting, sewing, screen printing,
embroidering, laundering, packaging and raw material plants and facilities, as
well as housing and residential facilities. Such inspections may be conducted
by John Varvatos, one of its affiliates or representatives or an accredited
audit company.
It has been and will continue to be our policy to obey the laws of each country
and to honor our obligations to society by being an economic, intellectual and
social asset to each community and nation in which we operate.
