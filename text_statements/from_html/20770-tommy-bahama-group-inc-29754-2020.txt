California Transparency in Supply Chains Act
   1. In 2010, California passed a law requiring companies to disclose what
      they are doing to address slavery and human trafficking in their supply
      chains. Referred to as SB 657, the California Transparency in Supply
      Chains Act seeks to "educate consumers on how to purchase goods produced
      by companies that responsibly manage their supply chains."
   2.

   3. Slavery is defined as "the act of holding an individual against his or
      her will and controlling that individual physically or psychologically by
      violence or its threat for the purpose of appropriating that individual's
      labor." Human trafficking is defined as "the obtaining, harboring, or
      transporting of a person from one area to another for the purpose of
      forcing them into slavery."
   4.

   5. Tommy Bahama manages its supply chain carefully and continually assesses
      its suppliers' compliance with its high standards for legal and ethical
      conduct, which include, among other things, zero tolerance for slavery
      and human trafficking.
   6.

   7. Tommy Bahama has adopted a Business Partner Code of Conduct that
      addresses, among other things, the issues of slavery and human
      trafficking and which apply to our direct suppliers. Our direct suppliers
      are evaluated on their compliance with this Business Partner Code of
      Conduct through on-site audits performed by our in-house compliance audit
      team. Confidential interviews between our in-house compliance audit team
      and our supplier's employees are a key component of the auditing process,
      as is the review of, among other things, compensation records, working
      hours and hiring practices.
   8.

   9. Tommy Bahama's product purchasing agreements require all suppliers to
      comply with all applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking.
  10.

  11. Tommy Bahama maintains and enforces internal accountability procedures
      for employees and contractors. If any evidence is found suggesting that
      slavery or human trafficking may be present, we will act accordingly. Any
      instances of non-compliance that are not resolved to Tommy Bahama's
      satisfaction, could, among other things, result in the termination of the
      employee or contractor.
  12.

  13. Tommy Bahama conducts internal training on our Business Partner Code of
      Conduct to ensure that the employees who work with our supply chain are
      aware of the issues surrounding human trafficking and slavery, and that
      processes are implemented internally to mitigate this risk.
