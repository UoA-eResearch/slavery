Global Brands Group Holding Ltd. ("GBG" or the "Company") is committed to legal
compliance and ethical busi- ness practices in all of our operations worldwide.
We choose suppliers and contractors who we believe share that commitment. GBG
takes the risks of slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain very
seriously. Like many companies manufacturing or selling products in California,
we are required to comply with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act
of 2010 (California Senate Bill 657). The law was designed to increase the
amount of information available to consumers about the efforts of manufacturers
and retailers to eliminate the risk of modern day slavery, forced labor, human
trafficking and similar human rights violations ("slavery and human
trafficking") from their supply chain. Accordingly, below are some examples of
how GBG is working to eliminate that risk from our supply chain.
Â 
RISK ASSESSMENT.Â The Company internally assesses the risk of slavery and human
trafficking with respect to the supply chain for all of its products. To judge
which of its sourcing countries presents the highest risk levels, the Company
utilizes several publicly available governmental and intergovernmental
resources. The Company continuously assesses its risk as these resources are
updated and as new, credible resources become available.
Â 
AUDITS.Â The Company conducts audits of its direct suppliers to evaluate
compliance with the Company's Global Supplier Principles, which include
standards for slavery and human trafficking in the supply chain. We utilize
unaffiliated third party workplace compliance audit firms and our agent
representatives to conduct both announced and unannounced factory audits on our
behalf. In addition, GBG is also a signatory to the global buyer principles of
the International Labor Organization (ILO)'s Better Work program and relies
upon indepen- dent Better Work factory assessments in lieu of our own
inspections in countries where Better Work operates. Current GBG sourcing
countries with active Better Work programs include Cambodia, Haiti, Nicaragua
and Vietnam. The Company also supports ongoing supplier improvements through
training and technical assistance.
Â 
SUPPLIER CERTIFICATION.Â The Company requires that all suppliers comply with
applicable laws within their country of business regarding slavery and human
trafficking. All GBG suppliers are required to adhere to the GBG Code of
Conduct which, among other things, prohibits child labor and any form of
forced, bonded, trafficked, indentured or prison labor, and requires compliance
with applicable laws and regulations regarding health and safety in working
conditions.
Â 
ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES.Â GBG maintains strong internal
accountability proce- dures, which are communicated through our Code of Conduct
and Business Ethics. All Company employees and agents with production, sourcing
or quality control responsibilities, as well as internal buying offices and
trading companies doing business with the Company, are provided with copies of
the Company"s Global Sup- plier Principles. In the case of non-compliance, the
Company examines the specific situation and develops an appropriate strategy
for resolution. GBG associates who regularly visit suppliers are also asked to
assess conditions informally while on location and report back any concerns,
and GBG Compliance and Production teams meet regularly to review supplier
performance on social compliance and discuss sourcing strategy.

TRAINING.Â The Company provides internal training to its managers and employees
with direct responsibility for supply chain management that specifically raises
awareness of slavery and human trafficking and focuses on mitigating the risks
within our supply chain. The Company encourages its agents, vendors and
suppliers to participate in seminars and training programs on social compliance
issues (including the issues of slavery and human trafficking) to further raise
awareness of the issues and mitigate the risks within the Company"s supply
chain.
