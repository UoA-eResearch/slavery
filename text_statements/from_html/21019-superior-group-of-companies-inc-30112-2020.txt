****** California Transparency in Supply Chains Act ******
Statement Regarding California Transparency In Supply Chains Act
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 seeks the elimination
of slavery and human trafficking from product supply chains and requires many
retailers and manufacturers that do business in California to publicly disclose
their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply
chains.
Superior Group of Companies, Inc. (Ã¢Â€ÂœSGCÃ¢Â€Â) embraces this goal.Ã‚Â  While we
believe the risk of slavery or human trafficking in our supply chain is low, we
nonetheless have a variety of mechanisms in place to assess and reduce the
risks.
*Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  *Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  *
SGC seeks to build relationships with our suppliers based on mutual benefit,
trust, performance, and a joint commitment to continuous improvement.Ã‚Â  We
require our suppliers to operate ethically and to comply with all contract
terms, laws, and regulations.Ã‚Â  Each supplier must agree to and comply with our
Contractor/Supplier Compliance Manual and/or other requirements, which, in
part, prohibits our contractors and suppliers from using involuntary or forced
labor and human trafficking.
SGC employs various methods for assessing the risk of slavery and human
trafficking in our supply chain, including routine visits to facilities by
employees and assessments by third-parties.Ã‚Â  Many of our supplierÃ¢Â€Â™s
facilities are assessed by the Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production
(WRAP) program, which is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to
the certification of lawful, humane, and ethical manufacturing throughout the
world.Ã‚Â  SGC also conducts periodic announced and unannounced audits and visits
of suppliersÃ¢Â€Â™ facilities and requires suppliers, when possible, to be
certified by an independent organization.
If needed, we work with our suppliers to develop a corrective action plan to
address gaps or vulnerabilities.Ã‚Â  A supplierÃ¢Â€Â™s failure to comply with our
expectations regarding slavery and human trafficking will result in termination
of the supplier relationship.Ã‚Â  We place a responsibility on our employees as
well.Ã‚Â  Our employees are required to report anything they observe or discover
that indicates our standards are not being met.Ã‚Â  Every employee is expected to
be an active proponent of our principles.Ã‚Â  Employees who fail to comply with
our expectations are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment.Ã‚Â  To minimize the risk of this occurring, our long
term goals include educating and training our employees involved in supply
chain management as to the risks of slavery and human trafficking.
