***** PVH Corp. Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement Under the California
Transparency in Supply Chains Act and UK Modern Slavery Act *****
This Statement provides an overview of the efforts that PVH Corp. (together
with its subsidiaries, “PVH,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) has taken,
including during our fiscal year that ended on February 3, 2019, to ensure that
slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our business or our supply
chain. We have prepared this Statement on a consolidated basis for PVH,
although not all of the entities in our consolidated group are subject to the
California Transparency in Supply Chains Act or the UK Modern Slavery Act,
because we have a common compliance program and common policies relating to
slavery and human trafficking across the Company.
Company Overview
PVH has excelled at growing brands and businesses with rich American heritages,
becoming one of the largest apparel companies in the world. We have over 38,000
associates operating in over 40 countries with over $9.7 billion in annual
revenues. We own the iconic CALVIN KLEIN, TOMMY HILFIGER, Van Heusen, IZOD,
ARROW, Speedo(1), Warner's, Olga and True&Co. brands and market a variety of
foods under these and other nationally and internationally known owned and
licensed brands. Please visit pvh.com/company/business-groups and pvh.com/
company/global-supply-chain for more information about our business and supply
chain structure.
We are committed to upholding the highest moral, ethical and legal standards in
all aspects of our business and across our supply chain, and to making a true
impact on the people, the environment and the communities where we work and
live. As part of this commitment, Corporate Responsibility (CR) is central to
how we conduct business. Please visit responsibility.pvh.com to read about our
CR program and efforts, as well as for links to our 2018 and prior years’
Annual CR Reports.
Alignment with International Standards & Policies
The requirements for doing business with PVH are based, in part, on the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization’s
Core Conventions and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and
Human Rights. We are also a founding member of the Fair_Labor_Association
(“FLA”). We have committed to the FLA’s ten Principles of Fair Labor and
Responsible Sourcing and Production and have agreed to uphold the FLA Workplace
Code of Conduct in our supply chain.
We communicate our standards and requirements to our business partners in our
supply chain through the following:
    * A_Shared_Commitment,our code of conduct for all of our business partners,
      a copy of which is provided to each of them at the outset of our
      relationship. First introduced in 1991, A Shared Commitment, prohibits
      forced and involuntary labor, whether in the form of prison labor,
      indentured labor, bonded labor or otherwise. In addition, A Shared
      Commitment states that mental and physical coercion, slavery and human
      trafficking are prohibited in our supply chain.
    * CR_Supply_Chain_Guidelines, which are provided to both licensees and
      suppliers during our onboarding process. The CR Supply Chain Guidelines
      and specifically our Migrant Worker Policy require suppliers to comply
      with a “no fees” policy and ensure that migrant workers are not
      responsible for paying fees or expenses to secure or maintain employment
      with the factory during any point during the employment cycle. We also
      recently updated the Migrant Worker Policy to provide more guidance to
      suppliers on the requirements for the responsible recruitment of migrant
      workers and how to address risks of forced labor comprehensively and in a
      sustainable manner.
    * Our Branded Merchandise Policy requires suppliers and licensees to
      certify affirmatively that materials used in the manufacture of our
      products are free from the use of slave labor and human trafficking.
Verification of Product Supply Chain to Evaluate, Monitor and Address Risks of
Human Trafficking
We evaluate, monitor and address the risks of slavery and human trafficking in
our industry and supply chain in several ways.
Evaluation
We participate in multi-stakeholder initiatives that help us to evaluate and
address slavery and human trafficking risks in our industry and supply chain.
PVH is a member of several industry associations and programs that are
dedicated to protecting workers’ rights, including the prevention of modern
slavery and human trafficking, such as the Responsible_Labor_Initiative,
American_Apparel_&_Footwear_Association (AAFA), the Accord_on_Fire_and_Building
Safety_in_Bangladesh, the United_States_Council_for_International_Business,
Better_Work, and the FLA. Notably, PVH is a member of the Responsible Labor
Initiative’s Steering Committee and provides strategic direction to the
organization as it works to ensure that the rights of workers vulnerable to
forced labor in global supply chains are consistently respected and promoted.
Additionally, PVH has signed a multi-stakeholder_letter to the governments of
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan conveying concern over forced labor issues in those
countries. PVH is also one of the signatories to AAFA/FLA_Apparel_&_Footwear
Industry_Commitment_to_Responsible_Recruitment aiming to address forced labor
risks for migrant workers.
We also consult third party resources and databases, engage in other research,
utilize consultants and engage with members of civil society to evaluate
slavery and human trafficking risk. PVH provides transparency through
reporting, survey responses, meetings with stakeholders and other means.
Monitoring/Addressing Risks
We continually monitor compliance with all of our CR requirements, including
the prohibition against forced or involuntary labor, and address any identified
risks or violations. We conduct pre-sourcing assessments before a factory is
allowed to produce PVH product, conduct regular audits once production begins,
work closely with factories to remediate any identified deficiencies and, when
necessary, terminate supplier factories that fail to comply with our policies,
procedures or guidelines.
Factory Audits: Audits are typically conducted by reputable third party
auditors or, to a lesser extent, by members of our CR team, every six to
twenty-four months. Several factors, including the results of the previous
audit, will dictate the actual frequency. Audits are usually scheduled in
advance with the suppliers in order to foster a relationship of trust and
cooperation but unannounced audits are conducted as necessary.
Audits are guided by a CR Assessment Tool that measures compliance through
metrics based on the requirements of A Shared Commitment, including specific
metrics tied to forced labor. The CR Assessment Tool drives greater objectivity
and consistency in our assessment program by ensuring that all suppliers
producing PVH product are evaluated based on consistent criteria. As part of
the audit, we also seek workers’ views in confidence, so that we can hear,
first hand, about factory conditions.
PVH’s audit program encourages our business partners to assume greater
responsibility for their labor practices and general compliance by providing
the opportunity for suppliers to remediate any identified issues. We also
reward those business partners that adopt and implement our standards and
policies with continued business.
Given the challenges with current recruitment systems, migrant workers can be
disproportionately vulnerable to situations amounting to forced labor. As such
PVH has worked with an external partner to identify high-risk countries for
migrant labor. In those countries, we have expanded the scope of our assessment
and pay heightened attention to issues relating to migrant workers. In
parallel, we have deepened our engagement with suppliers on recruitment fees
and other migrant labor issues.
Remediation: We believe that remediation best serves the interests of workers
by enabling the supplier to develop safe, compliant and respectful workplaces.
Therefore, if an audit reveals that a factory has failed to comply with our
standards, policies or other requirements, we typically work with the factory
to remediate the issues. We engage factory managers in an open discussion on
the findings, exploring root causes, and support them in developing corrective
action plans (“CAPs”). In addition, we meet with our suppliers between audits
to review their progress in implementing remediation activities and to provide
further guidance.
Termination: We will generally terminate a relationship with a supplier or
factory if (i) it fails to successfully remediate issues uncovered by an audit
or (ii) we identify what we would consider an egregious violation of our
policies or guidelines and remediation is not appropriate or feasible.
Certifications: At the beginning or renewal of a relationship, suppliers are
required to acknowledge A Shared Commitment and agree to implement its
requirements. PVH also requires under its Branded Merchandise Policy that
direct suppliers and licensees certify that materials incorporated into PVH
products, whether acquired directly or indirectly, are from a source that does
not use forced or involuntary labor and is not involved in human trafficking.
Internal Accountability & Training
Our commitment to upholding the high standards that we require for our Company
and business partners is reinforced at the most senior levels of PVH. Our Board
of Directors has a Corporate Responsibility Committee that is responsible for
advising our Board and management on policies and strategies that affect the
Company's role as a socially responsible organization.
All associates are required to undergo compliance and ethics training,
including the review and certification of our core policies, upon hire and
annually thereafter. The Company may take disciplinary action against any
associate who violates any of our policies, guidelines or otherwise fails to
uphold our high moral, legal or ethical standards.
PVH also provides management and associates who have direct responsibility for
supply chain processes with training on slavery and human trafficking on an as-
needed basis. Members of our CR team and other PVH associates attend external
training programs and seminars on social compliance issues, including slavery
and human trafficking. We have a reporting hotline for associates, which has
been extended to factory workers, so that they may report potential legal,
regulatory, or policy violations and other ethical concerns. Grievances can be
made anonymously and confidentially to the extent allowed under applicable law.
As an external verification of our CR program, we submit to the FLA
accreditation standard, which incorporates an independent evaluation of each
member's “systems and procedures required for successfully upholding fair labor
standards throughout brands’ supply chains.” We have continuously maintained
our accreditation since 2005.
External Training
We conduct targeted training for suppliers that may have an increased risk of
slavery or human trafficking. Our CR team and other PVH associates also
participate as speakers in other external training programs and seminars on
slavery and human trafficking to increase awareness and encourage the adoption
of best practices to address these issues.
