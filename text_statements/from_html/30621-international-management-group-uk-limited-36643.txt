MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT

MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT
This statement is published on behalf of International Management Group (UK)
Limited and IMG Media Limited, and their subsidiaries (âIMGâ) pursuant to
section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act of 2015. It constitutes our modern
slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31
December 2018.
IMG is committed to combatting slavery in all forms, including human
trafficking, forced labour and workplace abuse. This statement sets out the
steps that IMG has undertaken, and is continuing to take, to ensure that
slavery and human trafficking do not take place in any part of our business or
our supply chains.
Our Business Structure
IMG is part of the Endeavor group of companies and our ultimate parent company
is Endeavor Operating Company, LLC, which is headquartered in Beverly Hills,
California. IMG headquarters are in London, United Kingdom and operates
globally. Its businesses include sports, fashion, events and client management.
Our Supply Chain
As a company focused on media sales, events and talent representation, the vast
majority of our businesses use a variety of third party suppliers across the
company to provide us with standard goods and services necessary to operate,
which may include logistical support services, IT and office goods and
services. Where IMG enters into markets that may require additional diligence
it will use appropriate measures to guard against any forms of slavery or
forced labour in its supply chain.
Our Policies and Procedures
IMG has implemented several policies and procedures, the aim of which are to
help ensure that slavery and human trafficking do not form part of our business
or supply chains, including:
 
1. Employee Code of Conduct
All IMG employees are required to act in accordance with the principles set
forth in our Companyâs Code of Conduct (the âCodeâ). The Code states that
employees have a responsibility to uphold the highest standards of business
conduct and ethics, and to speak out if they see or suspect someone of
violating these standards, any Company policy, or engaging in any illegal
behaviour. Our Companyâs Code of Conduct is revised periodically, and an
updated Code is expected to be issued in 2019.
 
2. The Endeavor Ethics Helpline
Further to the above, our Company has established the Endeavor Ethics Helpline
(the âHelplineâ) to facilitate reporting of potential violations of our
Companyâs policies or applicable laws. The Helpline provides an avenue for
employees and others to raise concerns (anonymously if preferred and where
permitted by law) 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in a
variety of languages. All information is recorded by an independent third party
who then provides the details to an internal investigator to handle as
appropriate.
 
3. Third Party Due Diligence
IMG requires that vendors and suppliers in high-risk jurisdictions undergo a
due diligence screening process to identify public records indicating a history
of bribery or corruption or other indications of illegal activity. This
screening protocol has been implemented across the majority of our Companyâs
business units and is designed to detect risk factors such as application of
sanctions, involvement of politically exposed persons, and publication of
adverse news media reports, including reporting regarding any involvement with
slave labor or human trafficking.
 
4. Contractual Obligations
IMG incorporates into its contracts an obligation for contracting parties to
comply with all applicable laws, including the Modern Slavery Act where
applicable.
 
5. Training
We have previously engaged an external specialist law firm to deliver specific
training on the Modern Slavery Act to IMGâs UK-based law department. We plan
to conduct refresher training in the future, as well as to extend the training
to other relevant business units.
This statement has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of
International Management Group (UK) Limited and IMG Media Limited.
