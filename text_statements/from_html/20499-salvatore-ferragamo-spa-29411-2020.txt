   1. THE_CALIFORNIA_TRANSPARENCY_IN_SUPPLY_CHAINS_ACT_OF_2010
***** THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT OF 2010 *****
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) ( Act ) went
into effect on January 1 , 2012. Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A. (Ferragamo or the
Company) supports the goals of the Act to eradicate slavery and human
trafficking in its supply chain and to provide consumers with information
regarding Ferragamo s efforts in this regard. Ferragamo has maintained a long-
standing commitment to ensure human rights for all workers in its supply chain.
The Company maintains a written Code of Ethics approved by its Board of
Directors that explicitly renounces and opposes the exploitation of minors and
the exploitation of employees in general. This Code of Ethics is distributed to
employees, third party agents, consultants, and suppliers. In addition, Special
Part G of the Company’s Organizational Model under Italian Law-Decree 231/ 2001
( Organizational Model ) requires Ferragamo managers every two years to obtain
from all third party suppliers certifications that they and their sub-
contractors comply with all national labor laws, including those laws relating
to minimum age, compensation, work conditions, and collective work agreements.
Ferragamo has implemented the following efforts recognized in the Act to combat
slavery and human trafficking in its supply chain:
Audit policies and procedures for verifying the supply chain: In accordance
with the Organizational Model, Ferragamo s quality control inspectors audit
third parties and sub-contractors in its supply chain for any Crimes Against
Individuals, including slavery and human trafficking. The Company inspectors
prepare a quality control report for each supplier that includes a section
explaining any findings resulting from its audit that indicate the possible
exploitation of workers. The audit reports are provided to the head of the
legal department for consideration and further action, if appropriate.
Supplier certification: The Company requests that all suppliers and sub-
contractors accept the principles and requirements set forth in the Code of
Ethics and the Organizational Model, which include provisions prohibiting slave
and forced labor.
Internal accountability standards: Ferragamo has implemented disciplinary
measures applicable to employees and third parties for violation of the Company
s Code of Ethics and Organizational Model. Violations are referred to the
Organismo di Vigilanza (an internal compliance department), the head of the
legal department and Human Resources department for disciplinary actions.
Disciplinary actions include cancellation of a suppliers contractual
relationship with the Company.
Employee training: Ferragamo provides training to its employees and managers on
complying with the Company’s Organizational Model including Special section G
that deals with Crimes Against Individuals. Ferragamo is committed to upholding
human rights throughout the Company, including in its supply chain. The Company
will continue to update its corporate policies to reflect its progress in
preventing and addressing potential labor and human rights violations in its
supply chain, particularly in the areas of slavery and human trafficking.
