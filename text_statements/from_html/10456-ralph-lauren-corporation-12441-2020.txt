guest engage in anti-social or inappropriate activities in conjunction with
participation to The Goodwood Revival, or any other portion of the Prize, Ralph
Lauren reserves the right to terminate the Prize (with Ralph Lauren having no
liability to Winner/guest relative to such decision) and/or to take other
actions deemed necessary in its sole discretion so as to protect its rights. In
case of blackouts or other force majeure events (such as strikes or Acts of
God, etc.), Ralph Lauren reserves the right to cancel the Prize without any
right of claim upon the Winner. The Prize is awarded subject to Ralph Lauren
being satisfied of the Winnerâs eligibility, and Ralph Lauren may require
such information as reasonably necessary to verify the Winnerâs eligibility.
If the Prize is not available and to the extent practicable, Ralph Lauren will
provide a reasonable equivalent (unless such non-availability may be
attributable to the Winner or is the result of force majeure events). The Prize
can only be awarded to the Winner designated by name. The Prize must be
accepted as awarded and cannot be sold, auctioned, exchanged or bartered for
cash or any other valuable consideration, reproduced or altered, otherwise it
is void. Lost, stolen or damaged Prize cannot be replaced. The Winner will be
solely responsible for their own costs and expenses (including the guestâs

exclusive responsibility of the Winner. Selection of Winner: (the
âWinnerâ): The Winner will be determined in a random draw on September 10,
2019, amongst all eligible entries. The random draw will be conducted via a
random computer process and only one Winner will be identified. The Winner will
be contacted by e-mail within one (1) calendar days after the random draw and
will be (i) asked to confirm the county of residence and (ii) given
instructions on how to receive the Prize. If Ralph Lauren is unable to
successfully get into contact with the Winner within a two (2) calendar daysâ
period, or the Winner declines the Prize, such unclaimed or declined Prize may
be re-awarded at Ralph Laurenâs sole discretion. Additional Rules: If
participants and/or the Winner do not meet the criteria set in these Official
Rules or if events occur that render the awarding of the Prize impossible due
to reasons beyond the control of Ralph Lauren, its affiliates or employees, and
other suppliers of the Prize (collectively the âSponsorsâ), Ralph Lauren
may, at its absolute discretion, vary, amend, suspend, withhold, cancel or
withdraw the Prize with or without notice. Ralph Lauren reserves the right, at

whatsoever. All decisions by Ralph Lauren with respect to all aspects of the

of the instructions and decisions of Ralph Lauren. In the event of any dispute

sharing of Consumer Personal Data.
Except as permitted or required by applicable law, Ralph Lauren provides
Consumers with an opportunity to opt out of sharing their Personal Data with

relevant Consumer. In addition, to the extent necessary for these purposes,
Ralph Lauren takes reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data the
company processes is (i) reliable for its intended use, and (ii) accurate,

where appropriate, Ralph Lauren provides Consumers with reasonable access to
the Personal Data Ralph Lauren maintains about them. Ralph Lauren also provides
a reasonable opportunity for those Consumers to correct, amend or delete the
information where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the
Privacy Shield Principles, as appropriate. Ralph Lauren may limit or deny
access to Personal Data where the burden or expense of providing access would
be disproportionate to the risks to the Consumer's privacy in the case in
question, or where the rights of persons other than the Consumer would be
violated. Consumers may request access to their Personal Data by contacting
Ralph Lauren as indicated below.
**** Recourse, Enforcement and Liability ****
Ralph Lauren has mechanisms in place designed to help assure compliance with
the Privacy Shield Principles. Ralph Lauren conducts an annual self-assessment
of its Consumer Personal Data practices to verify that the attestations and

Personal Data. Ralph Lauren will take steps to remedy issues arising out of its
alleged failure to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles. Consumers may
contact Ralph Lauren as specified below about complaints regarding Ralph
Lauren's Consumer Personal Data practices.

processes, Ralph Lauren will cooperate with JAMS pursuant to the JAMS Privacy
Shield Program, which is described on the JAMS website at https://
www.jamsadr.com. JAMS mediation may be commenced as provided for in the JAMS
rules. Following the dispute resolution process, the mediator or the Consumer
may refer the matter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which has Privacy
Shield investigatory and enforcement powers over Ralph Lauren. Under certain

In the event that the sum due from you for your order cannot be debited or
charged for whatever reason, your order will be cancelled
By making an offer to purchase products through our Website, you authorise us,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, to perform credit and anti-fraud
checks on you and the payment mechanism that you have provided. These checks
may be required, amongst other things, to authenticate your identity, to
validate your credit or debit card, to obtain an initial credit or debit card
authorisation and/or to authorise individual purchases. You authorise us to
disclose information provided by you, including personal information, to third
parties such as banks and the providers of credit reports for the purposes of
these checks, and acknowledge that such parties may keep a record of that
information. You further agree and acknowledge that we may make the information
we receive from such checks available to third parties including fraud
prevention and credit reference agencies. We reserve the right to put in place
additional payment security systems from time to time.
For your convenience, your credit or debit card information can be stored in
your account. For added security, the billing address you provide must exactly
match the address on file at your debit or credit card. The processing of your
order may be delayed if these addresses are different.
We will prosecute any fraudulent activities relating to any attempt to reverse
or seek a refund of a valid charge for an order that has been properly
fulfilled and delivered to you and is not subject to a right of return.
 
Order Tracking and Delivery
Once your order has been confirmed, we endeavour to dispatch purchases within
one (1) to two (2) working days of confirming your order (working days exclude
Saturdays, Sundays and Public holidays), and to deliver your order in
accordance with the timescales set out in our Shipping_Policy Stated delivery
times are estimates only, and are measured from the date of dispatch. Each
address you instruct us to deliver to, including gift-recipient addresses, is
considered a separate order and is subject to applicable delivery charges.
Customising a product requires additional processing time for your entire
order, and all orders that include RL Custom Shop product may take longer to
deliver.
Once your order is placed, we will send an e-mail confirming the details of
your order and the selected delivery method. Your Order History on the Website
lists the current status of pending orders. You may check your order status
through the Order History area of My Account or the Track Your Orders option.
You can also Contact_Us. We will email you a confirmation once your order is
ready for dispatch.

responsibility and risk for the products you have purchased through this
Website passes to you on delivery. In the event that you have purchased a
product as a gift for a third party you agree that signature by a person at the
stated delivery address is proof of fulfilment of your order.
For security reasons, Ralph Lauren cannot ship any order to Post Office Boxes
or accept any order where it is impossible to identify the individual delivery
address. Ralph Lauren's policies do not allow product to be reshipped and
therefore we cannot ship to an address associated with a "freight forwarding
company". We do not deliver outside the relevant Territory. We do, however,
have Ralph Lauren stores all over the world. Please use the Store locator on
the Website to find the store nearest you.
 
Your right to Cancel an Order and Returns

We may refuse returns where products are soiled, show signs that they have been
worn, the tags have been removed or the adhesive strip has been removed.
Alternatively we may make a deduction from any refund due to you for loss in
value of any product you return, if the loss is the result of unnecessary
handling or use by you.
We will prosecute any fraudulent activities, including without limitation, any
attempt to reverse or seek a refund of a valid charge for an order that has
been properly fulfilled and delivered to you and is not subject to a right of
return.
