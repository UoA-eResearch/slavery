TRANSPARENCY SUPPLY CHAIN ******
 
**** Element 1 ****
Engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks
of human trafficking and slavery. The disclosure shall specify if the
verification was not conducted by a third party.

labor to our suppliers. Suppliers are audited by an independent third party to
help insure adherence to our expectations.
 
===============================================================================
 
**** Element 2 ****
Conducts audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company
standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. The disclosure shall
specify if the verification was an independent, unannounced audit.

audits on our behalf and on the behalf of our customers. Auditors perform
comprehensive investigations. Announced and unannounced visits are performed at
random.
 
===============================================================================
 
**** Element 3 ****
Requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the
product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the
country or countries in which they are doing business.
RG Barry requires all suppliers to comply with all laws regarding all forms of
forced labor including but not limited to: slavery, indentured, bonded, child
or prison labor and human trafficking. This is detailed on our Terms of
Engagement, a document that must be signed by all suppliers and posted in a
location visible to all their employees at all facilities.
 
===============================================================================
 
**** Element 4 ****
Maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or
contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and
trafficking.
RG Barry Corporation requires suppliers and factories to sign our Terms of
Engagement. This document requires all government, industry, and RG Barry
standards be met. Our TOE, which must be posted in a visible and accessible
location within the facility, contains several forms for supplier employees to
contact our Global Ethics Office and report any violation of these standards.
RG Barry will not tolerate doing business with suppliers that are noncompliant.
 
===============================================================================
 
**** Element 5 ****
Provides company employees and management, who have direct responsibility for
supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery,
particularly with respect to mitigating risks within supply chains of products.
RG Barry's Code of Ethical Business Conduct is published annually. This
document outlines our expectation for ethical behaviors throughout our
organization. RG Barry also utilizes a standard operating procedure when
selecting suppliers. RG Barry relies on the audit reports from our independent
auditors. Should there be any concerns raised by these auditors, RG Barry would
address at that time.
