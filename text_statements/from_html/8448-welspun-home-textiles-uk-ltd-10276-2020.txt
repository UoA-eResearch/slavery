Ethics and Compliance Policy
It is the policy of Welspun Home Textiles Group to comply with all applicable
laws and regulations in the countries where Welspun conducts business. 
Our due diligence processes
We have taken steps to identify, assess, and monitor potential areas of risk in
relation to our supply chains.
Welspun Home Textiles UK Ltd has established processes in place to vet
potential and current suppliers for their involvement in modern slavery and
human trafficking; such processes include on-site audits for those suppliers
deemed to be in the medium and high risk categories. This compliance due
diligence includes, amongst other things, screening of Welspun Home Textiles UK

evidence of slavery or human trafficking with one of our suppliers through this
process, we will refrain from doing business with this supplier and will report
such conduct to the relevant authorities, as appropriate.
Welspun Home Textiles UK Ltd regularly takes steps to identify the area of its
business and its supply chains that are most at risk in relation to modern
slavery and human trafficking by on-site audits for those suppliers deemed to
be in the medium and high risk categories.
Training
To maintain internal accountability, all relevant personnel are trained to
recognise environment, health, safety, and labour/worker concerns, including
issues relating to slavery, human trafficking and forced labour, and to report
and investigate all suspicions of improper conduct at all suppliers globally.
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and
human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, we will provide
training from time to time to relevant members of staff and workers.
Looking ahead
The Company will continue to develop its practices in respect of combatting
slavery or human trafficking to target areas of its business where there is a
potential risk of modern slavery. Further training for employees and its supply
chain, with an increased emphasis on transparency, may help identify modern
slavery risks. Welspun Home Textiles UK Ltd shall perform social audit review
of the suppliers from time to time.
We shall in future measure our effectiveness by:-
Ensuring there are Independent Ethical Audits or Social certification for every
factory / supplier otherwise, we will not engage the business relationship
