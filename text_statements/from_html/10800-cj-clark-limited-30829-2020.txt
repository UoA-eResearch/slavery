****** Clarks Modern Slavery & California Transparency Act Statement ******

***** INTRODUCTION *****
This is our third Modern Slavery Statement published in accordance with the
Modern Slavery Act 2015 (MSA) and the California Transparency in Supply Chains
Act 2010 (CTA).
One of the key principles of Clarksâ Code of Business Ethics (for employees)
and Clarksâ Code of Practice (for suppliers) is to treat everyone fairly and
with dignity and respect. This includes everyone from within our business and
also, importantly, everyone within our supply chain.
This Statement is made pursuant to the MSA and CTA. The statement is made by
C&J Clark Limited as parent company of the subsidiaries listed in Appendix 1
and includes the activities of those subsidiaries. It outlines the measures
Clarks has taken to assess and reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking
occurring in our business or supply chains during the financial year 2018/19.
The statement also outlines our commitments to continue to mitigate risk in the
year 2019/20.
***** CLARKS OVERVIEW – ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE *****
C&J Clark Limited is a privately-owned limited liability company registered in
England and Wales. The term âClarksâ as used in this statement refers
collectively to C&J Clarks Limited and its subsidiaries as listed in Appendix
1.
Clarks has been a shoemaker since 1825. Nearly 200 years later, Clarks designs,
develops, sources and sells footwear and accessories globally, operating in
over 95 countries. Clarksâ products are sold through our own retail and
outlet stores as well as through stores operated by our franchise partners,
licensees, joint venture partners and wholesale customers. Clarks sell products
online via our digital platforms and third-party digital marketplaces. As of
the year ending, 2nd February 2019, Clarks employed in the region of 11,700
people including part time employees.
Clarksâ commercial operating model is structured across three regions -
Europe, Americas and Asia Pacific. Each region is supported by corporate
functions providing services in Human Resources, Finance, IT, Legal,
Compliance, Marketing and Supply Chain.
Our Brand hubs are located at Clarksâ headquarters in Somerset UK and Boston
USA, focusing on product design, line management and creative and marketing
activities. Development and sourcing activities are also located in the UK and
USA with several locations in Asia, including China, Vietnam and India.
***** OUR SUPPLY CHAINS *****
Clarks undertake the design and development of our products but outsource the
manufacturing. In most factories, the facilities are shared with production for
other brands.
Most of Clarksâ footwear products are sourced through suppliers overseen by
the Clarksâ Sourcing Operations team. The Chief Supply Chain Officer is
accountable for managing the Clarksâ supply chain and part of that role is
ensuring Clarksâ business aspires to good ethical and environmentally
sustainable practices.
Approximately 85% of Clarksâ footwear is sourced through direct managed
factories meaning they are managed by our own sourcing operations teams. A
further 12% is sourced through four non-direct managed factories. The final 3%
is sourced through specialist agents who also source for other companies and
consolidate our orders with others to buy in large volumes. Clarks pay a fee
but ensure that appropriate due diligence is carried out to determine that both
the agents, and their suppliers, work to required standards.
Clarks have long standing relationships with many of our suppliers and more
than 80% of our footwear is produced by suppliers Clarks have been working with
for over 5 years.
In 2018, Clarks sourced most of our footwear from suppliers based in Asia
(Vietnam, China, Cambodia, India and Indonesia), with small volumes from
Bangladesh and Laos. Clarks also source small quantities from within Europe.
Production was undertaken through 59 factories producing finished shoes. In
India there are 33 stitching units producing partly made uppers, which work in
tandem with the factories. This enables them to focus on specific skills. There
can be as many as 4 stitching units working with a factory. There are 2
stitching units in Vietnam.
For footwear sourced from direct managed factories, Clarks nominates who is to
supply key materials and components. This includes the tanneries supplying the
leather, the factories supplying the sole units, packaging materials such as
shoe boxes, tissue paper and transit cartons as well as some other non-leather
materials.
Non-footwear products such as handbags and accessories make up a small part of
the Clarksâ business, representing approximately 2% of total revenues. These
are all sourced through specialist agents for each product type. The production
of these goods takes place mainly within China and India with some specialist
goods produced in Vietnam, Guatemala and the United States.
As at the date of this statement, Clarks has no issues with any of its
suppliers, trade unions or other bodies representing workers that it considers
should be disclosed in the context of the MSA.
Further information can be found in our Corporate Responsibility pages on
www.Clarks.com
***** OUR POLICIES: ADDRESSING THE RISKS *****
Clarks has several policies which support the fight against modern slavery and
trafficking.
**** Code of Business Ethics (Employees) ****
Our Code of Business Ethics outlines the global values and principles that help
shape the way Clarks work and describes our internal accountability, standards
and expectations. It is primarily aimed at employees and Clarks encourage our
business partners, including suppliers, franchise and joint venture partners,
to adopt and apply the Code of Business Ethics wherever they represent or
promote the Clarksâ brand. Clarks attach real importance to the welfare of
our employees and those employed by our suppliers. The key principles include:
    * We treat all employees and each other fairly, with dignity and respect;
    * We operate with integrity and honesty; and
    * We base our business relationships on respect; and expect the same from
      those that we do business with.
As part of a periodic review in 2018, the Code of Business Ethics was updated
to incorporate our understanding and management of the risks of modern slavery
and human trafficking within our own business and our supply chains. It
includes a link to the International Labour Officeâs (ILO) Indicators of
Forced Labour for further guidance. The Code of Business Ethics specifically
references that âNo form of forced or compulsory labour or modern slavery is
tolerated by Clarks within our own operations or those of our business
partnersâ and includes indicators and warning signals that employees should
be to in helping prevent such issues. It details the various reporting channels
available to employees to report any concerns the Code of Business Ethics may
be being ignored. This includes an externally provided whistleblowing channel.
The Code of Business Ethics is communicated on an annual basis to all employees
and training records retained.
Our Code of Business Ethics can be found here
**** Code of Practice for Suppliers ****
All suppliers are expected to sign up to our Code of Practice as part of their
contract. Clarksâ Code of Practice states the minimum standards for working
conditions that Clarks expect our suppliers to adhere to in the production of
all Clarksâ products.
The Code is subject to ongoing review and an updated version was distributed in
April 2019. This update included the Consumer Goods Forum priority industry
principles of forced labour. The Consumer Goods Forum is a global, parity-based
industry network, driven by its members who come from over 70 countries and
reflect the diversity of the industry in geography, size, product category and
format. It is the only organisation that brings consumer goods retailers and
manufacturers together globally to collaborate, alongside other key
stakeholders, to secure consumer trust and drive positive change, including
greater efficiency. The Forum devised 3 key principles relating to slavery and
working conditions which they encourage their members to include within their
Code of Practice, namely:
"1. Every worker should have freedom of movement â the ability of workers to
move freely should not be restricted by the employer through physical
restriction, abuse, threats and practices such as retention of passports and
valuable possessions;
2. No worker should pay for a job â fees and costs associated with
recruitment and employment should be paid by the employer, not the employee;
and
3. No worker should be indebted or coerced to work â Workers should work
freely, aware of the terms and conditions of their work in advance and paid
regularly as agreed.
All workers should be provided free and unrestricted access to potable water
and clean toilet facilities.â
These principles have been included within our Code of Practice as well as
requirements to:
    * comply with all local legal and regulatory requirements of the country in
      which the facility is located; and
    * to recognise international standards and to uphold the core labour
      conventions of the ILO.
Where there is any conflict between these Clarks expect the higher standard to
be achieved. The Code contains specific requirements which underpin the
principles including âAll work must be conducted on a voluntary basis, and
not under threat of any penalty or sanctions. The supplier shall not use any
form of forced, bonded, indentured, trafficked, slave or involuntary prison
labourâ.
The Code must be applied to all suppliers regardless of which tier they are
within the supply chain.
The Responsible Sourcing Goods for Resale Committee (chaired by the Chief
Supply Chain Officer) monitors the application of the Code to ensure
conformance and reports to our Executive Committee. In addition, six monthly
reports from the Group Head of Supplier Working Conditions are required by and
reviewed by Clarksâ Audit Committee.
The Code of Practice for suppliers can be found here
**** Supplier Working Conditions Manual ****
Audits are a requirement within our Code of Practice. The Supplier Working
Conditions Manual clearly defines the supplier factory audit programme. Areas
covered include:
    * Scope;
    * Approach;
    * Risk assessment;
    * Tiering;
    * Criteria;
    * Scheduling and planning;
    * Reporting;
    * Governance;
    * Action plans; and
    * Training and development.
**** Speak-Up Policy ****
The Speak-Up/ Whistleblowing Policy is reviewed, updated where necessary and
re-communicated every year to all employees. Training records are retained. It
outlines the different methods available for reporting. The options are:
    * Line management;
    * ethics@clarks.com (an email to the Head of Compliance);
    * An external reporting company which gives webpage, phone and email
      options (all anonymous and accessed by Compliance personnel within
      Clarks); and
    * Globalauditchair@clarks.com (an email which goes directly and only to the
      Chair of Clarksâ Audit Committee).
The policy also includes information on Clarksâ commitment to zero tolerance
of any retaliation.
Summary reports from our global external whistle blowing service are provided
to our Group Head of Compliance and subsequently reported to the Chief Legal
Officer, the Group Director of Risk Management & Internal Audit and the Audit
Committee. The Audit Committee has responsibility for reviewing â policies
and processes with regards to whistleblowing and legal com duced to our
franchise partners over the next twelve months.
As at the date of this statement, Clarks has received no disclosures with
regards MSA pliance. As well as employees the facility is available to our
Joint Venture partners and is being intro issues.
**** Procurement Policy ****
The Clarks Procurement Policy exists to ensure accountable, efficient,
transparent, and ethical practices are used to acquire products and services.
The procurement team considers the legal and ethical responsibilities of Clarks
(including those of modern slavery) in aspects of supplier sourcing and
management including; supplier contracts, tender and purchasing processes,
auditing and compliance actions. Due diligence is completed before engaging
with a supplier, in the context of a manufacturer would include a requirement
for a site visit and audit of working conditions.
Our policy is reviewed and communicated annually, and training records
retained.
**** Breaches and Non-compliance ****
Clarks will not tolerate forced labour, slavery or human trafficking within our
direct operations or supply chains. Where any non-compliance is identified,
Clarks expect and support suppliers to act to address it.
Clarks actively work with them to make necessary improvements and any affected
supplier will be given the opportunity to produce an improvement action plan to
address issues identified. If a supplier does not take effective action in a
timely manner, withdrawing our business remains the final sanction.
Employees who breach the principles set out in our Code of Business Ethics and
related policies may be subject to disciplinary procedures.
**** Governance ****
Responsibility for the preparation of our Modern Slavery statement sits with
the Board of Directors.
The following departments are responsible for carrying out implementation of
policies and procedures that support Clarksâ human rights responsibilities:
Legal Department, Procurement Department, Supply Chain and the Group Head of
Supplier Working Conditions.
***** DUE DILIGENCE *****
**** Due Diligence ****
Clarks use supplier on boarding packs to communicate and certify our
requirements on forced labour and modern slavery to manufacturers and
suppliers. Suppliers are required to sign a copy of the Code of Practice to
confirm that they have received, reviewed and understand it, and that they are
in, or working towards, full compliance with its requirements. Where
appropriate and based on the level of risk, audits are conducted of any
potential new supplier prior to any purchase order for bulk production being
placed.
Clarks strives to ensure that compliance with the Code of Practice forms part
of the terms and conditions of all purchase orders.
Clarks have updated our Supplier Working Conditions Manual to incorporate
forced labour and modern slavery requirements and are working with non-direct
managed factories to introduce a facility authorisation process to ensure
Clarks have input into all and any facilities being used, and the associated
working conditions. Clarks have also introduced a Grievance mechanism into the
direct managed factories and our intention is to introduce this into non-direct
managed factories by the end of the year and include within audits.
**** Risk Assessment and Management ****
Clarks currently trades, operates and sources in many countries and across
borders where the risk of modern slavery is perceived to be high. The evidence
shows that whilst modern slavery is illegal in every country in the world, it
still occurs.
Our supply chains are global and complex especially below the first tier of
suppliers. To ensure Clarks utilise our resources effectively in monitoring
compliance with our Code of Practice, Clarks uses a geographic assessment of
risk as an initial indicator.
Following a review, in early 2017 Clarks adopted the British Standards
Institute (BSI)_SCREEN_system threat ratings which provides a more
comprehensive and granular geographic assessment. This includes information
sources relevant to the use of forced labour in each country.
Clarks approach to risk assessment comprises of research, supply chain mapping,
auditing, training and stakeholder engagement. Most of Clarksâ manufacturing
takes place within the Asia Pacific region and this is where according to the
2017 ILOâs Report 62% of modern slavery is believed to exist. Manufacturing
is regarded to be a high risk activity and accounts for 15% of those
individuals in modern slavery. Therefore, Clarks works with a number of
stakeholders who help us to ensure Clarks are continuously reviewing and
mitigating our risk in the supply chain. Clarks have had a formal risk
assessment completed and are working on the recommendations from this.
The following have been identified as vulnerable to the risks of modern
slavery:
    * migrant workers;
    * minority groups;
    * homeworkers; and
    * contract, agency, temporary or outsourced workers.
The following indicators have been identified as potential indicators of modern
slavery and have been included within our Code of Business Ethics and training
materials to raise awareness:
    * someone who does not have their own passport, ID or travel documents;
    * someone who always allows others to speak for them or talks as though
      being instructed or coached by someone else;
    * someone who may be withdrawn or appear frightened and may have injuries;
    * a person who has limited social interaction and may always be dropped off
      or collected from work (they may not be able to contact friends or family
      freely;
    * a person with very few possessions or who lives in a very poorly
      maintained, overcrowded place (and is often overcharged for this);
    * a person who has little control over their finances or no access to a
      bank account;
    * recruitment fees and labour agents;
    * cash in hand payments;
    * no unions; and/or
    * no access to grievance mechanisms.
These are not conclusive evidence but are all warning signs.
**** Stakeholders ****
**** Supplier Working Conditions Team ****
There are 5 auditors working within the Clarksâ Supplier Working Conditions
team across both direct managed and non-direct managed factories in China,
India and Vietnam. In all other locations Clarks use reputable third party
auditors to conduct audits within the factories. Each employee is salaried and
is not incentivised on audit results. The companies providing the audits
undergo due diligence checks as part of their onboarding. Clarks are working on
a facility authorisation process which will require non-direct managed
suppliers to provide us with a recent audit report before Clarks do business
with them. This will be implemented this year.
**** Supplier Relationships ****
The Chief Supply Officer is accountable for supplier relationships. The Senior
Vice President of Global Sourcing Operations is responsible for the
relationships with the direct managed factories. Product buyers are responsible
for the relationships within their specific product division. If there are
concerns over performance these individuals decide whether to continue to do
business.
Over the last year Clarks have been working with the Mekong Club to improve our
understanding of forced labour and modern slavery and how to identify and
prevent, which has included trialing their Apprise mobile phone application
which helps us to identify indicators of forced labour when conducting worker
interviews as part of our audit.
Clarks have, and will continue to, support the Pacific Links Foundation in the
delivery of their Factory Awareness to Counter Trafficking (FACT) programme. It
is a part of the Pacific Links Foundationâs wider efforts to counter
trafficking in Vietnam by increasing access to education, providing shelter and
reintegration services, and enabling economic opportunities. Clarks have used
their programme as the basis for education and awareness within our sites in
Vietnam. Further information on the Pacific_Links_Foundation and the FACT
programme can be found on their website.
Clarks have signed up to membership with Slave Free Alliance to gain further
insight into all aspects of modern slavery and trafficking and how Clarks can
continue to mitigate risks.
Clarks work closely with the Institute of Business Ethics to ensure that ethics
are at the core of our policies and practices.
**** Audit Programme ****
Audits are conducted either by our in-house Supplier Working Conditions team or
by independent and reputable third-party service providers on our behalf. As
well as conducting scheduled audits Clarks also introduced semi-announced audit
(where Clarks notify the factory a fortnight prior to the audit) and
unannounced visits which encourage our suppliers to continue to meet standards.
A factory that has historically shown a high standard of working conditions and
good management systems will have an audit at least every 18 months. Others are
received more frequently.
Our audits are undertaken against criteria that assess the level of compliance
by the facility to the working condition standards set out in Clarksâ Code of
Practice. The audit process includes a review of business licenses and relevant
documentation, interviews with management and workers and an inspection of all
areas of the facility site. Auditors also look for ILO indicators of forced
labour and modern slavery.
For existing suppliers, Clarks use a tiered approach to determine the frequency
of any audits based on their compliance performance and management capability
including the balanced scorecard, which incorporates audit results and
improvement action undertaken. Clarks assign a compliance level and risk rating
to each facility and scorecard results as part of our criteria for sourcing
allocation and those factories which score better receive more orders.
In the first instance, Clarks want the information gathered through our audit
program to be used by the factories to take action to improve conditions where
necessary. It is also used to inform both operational and strategic sourcing
decisions at all tiers of our supply chain.
Clarks do not use any footwear supplier with the lowest compliance level
(defined as a facility with critical issues including a lack of willingness and
commitment by the senior factory management to engage and take appropriate
corrective actions).
In 2012 Clarks set increasing targets for the proportion of footwear from
supplier facilities with a risk rating of low or medium. Supplies from these
has increased from 63% in 2012 to 97% at the end of 2017 and has remained at
this level over the last twelve months. The improvement was a result of both
improved conditions in some existing facilities and the reallocation of
production to countries and facilities with better working conditions.
In 2018 factories producing over 99% of our footwear were all audited. In
addition to audits at finished goods facilities, Clarks undertook audits of
second tier material and component suppliers. These audits covered tanneries
and sole suppliers that supplied at least 90% of the volume of these materials
from Clarksâ nominated suppliers as well as other component and material
suppliers.
***** KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS *****
Over the course of the last year Clarks have redefined ongoing KPIs and now
report on these on a seasonal (six monthly) rather than annual basis. KPIs
Clarks use are:
    * Audit results
    * Balanced scorecard
    * Training compliance
    * Whistleblowing reports
***** TRAINING *****
Clarks have undertaken activities to support greater awareness and mitigation
towards modern slavery and trafficking. These include:
**** Internal (employees) ****
    * Implementing corporate training on modern slavery to raise awareness as
      to what to look out for and to ensure employees their responsibilities;
      and
    * Annual communication of this statement to all corporate employees.
**** External ****
    * Clarks supported the Pacific Links Foundation in the delivery of their
      Factory Awareness to Counter Trafficking (FACT) program at some of our
      suppliers in Vietnam. The FACT program offers a series of workshops for
      factory managers and workers to raise awareness about trafficking
      prevention.
    * Clarks worked with the Mekong Club, which is a leader at uniting and
      mobilising the private sector for a common cause - to disrupt and end
      modern slavery. They provide training materials which help raise
      awareness when used in the workplace. Clarks have used aspects of this
      within our internal training.
During 2019 Clarks will continue to work to increase awareness of risks and
reporting channels, including specific training on modern slavery and human
trafficking for all corporate employees, as well as franchisees and
contractors.
Clarks remain committed to tackling the root causes of modern slavery through
raising awareness and engaging with stakeholders on policy and legislation and
ensuring ongoing monitoring of activity. It is essential that Clarks continue
to develop and adapt our approach to encompass emerging issues. Clarks continue
to work with industries towards combatting modern slavery within our supply
chain and operations.
