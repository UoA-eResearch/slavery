**** CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS & U.K. Modern Slavery ACTs
DISCLOSURE STATEMENT ****
As of January 1, 2012, Californiaâs Civil Code section 1714.43 (California
Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010) requires manufacturers and retailers
to provide website information concerning their efforts to address the issues
of forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking within the supply chain. The
U.K. Modern Slavery Act of 2015 Â (U.K. MSA) requires similar disclosures.Â 
The purpose is to allow consumers to make better and more informed decisions
about the products they buy and the companies they support. Hanesbrands Inc.,
as a parent company, issues this statement on behalf of itself and each of its
subsidiaries that are subject to the U.K. MSA and California Transparency in
Supply Chains Act of 2010.Â  For the purposes of this statement, Hanesbrands
Inc. and each of its subsidiaries subject to the U.K. MSA and California
Transparency in Supply Chains of 2010 are collectively referred to as
âHanesBrands.â
HanesBrands is required to inform the public as to how it has addressed the
following issues:
   1. Verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of
      human trafficking and slavery. The disclosure shall specify if the
      verification was not conducted by a third party.
   2. Audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company
      standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. The disclosure
      shall specify if the verification was not an independent, unannounced
      audit.
   3. Certification by direct suppliers that materials incorporated into the
      product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of
      the country or countries in which they are doing business.
   4. Internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or
      contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and
      trafficking.
   5. Training of company employees and management who have direct
      responsibility for supply chain management on issues of human trafficking
      and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the
      supply chains of products.
A full description of our efforts and processes to address the issues of forced
labor, slavery, and human trafficking within the supply chain is set forth
below.
HANESBRANDSâ BUSINESS AND STRUCTURE
HanesBrands is a manufacturer and the worldâs largest marketer of everyday
basic apparel, including bras, panties, shapewear, sheer hosiery, menâs
underwear, childrenâs underwear, socks, T-shirts, sweatshirts, fleece and
other activewear.
HanesBrands has over 65,000 employees in more than 40 countries.Â  Unlike most
apparel companies, Hanes primarily operates its own manufacturing facilities.Â 
The vast majority of the apparel units that HanesBrands sells worldwide are
manufactured in HanesBrandsâ own plants or those of dedicated contractors.
HANESBRANDSâ APPROACH TO SOCIAL COMPLIANCE AND LABOR STANDARDS
HanesBrands takes great pride in its strong reputation for ethical business
practices and the success of the Hanes for Good corporate responsibility
program for workplace practices and community and environmental improvement.Â 
More information about our Hanes for Good corporate responsibility initiatives
may be found at www.HanesforGood.com.
HanesBrands is proud to have implemented a rigorous set of standards for both
its company-owned facilities and its suppliers for well over a decade.
OurÂ Global_Standards_for_SuppliersÂ (GSS) and Global Human Rights Policy,
which can be found on www.HanesforGood.com, Â are primarily based on
international labor and human rights standards. We believe that all workers at
our owned and supplier factories have the right to freely choose employment and
to freely associate and collectively bargain. Our standards specifically
prohibit âforced or involuntary labor whether bonded, prison or indentured,
including debt servitude.â
We are also a fully accredited member of the Fair Labor Association (FLA), an
internationally recognized non-governmental organization (NGO) whose goal is to
advance labor rights globally and to help industry appropriately address a
range of complex issues â including the eradication of forced and slave labor
across the supply chain. Our work with the FLA, and other global NGOs and
organizations, has proven valuable in our efforts to ensure that all of our
suppliers are compliant with our own GSS and relevant international laws.
HanesBrands realizes that forced labor and human trafficking can occur in many
forms â such as child labor, workplace harassment, workplace abuse, and
workplace discrimination. Therefore, our processes (described below) were
created in an effort to making meaningful improvements to workersâ employment
and workplace conditions.
(1) Verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of
human trafficking and slavery.
HanesBrands itself regularly performs evaluations of its supply chain to
evaluate the risk of slavery, human trafficking and other human rights
violations and labor issues. Further verification efforts are described in
detail below.
(2) Audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards
for trafficking and slavery in supply chains.
HanesBrands has consistently worked for many years to audit suppliers to ensure
that slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in its supply chain.
The intensity and frequency of these audits vary based on our risk evaluations
and also on the historical performance of a given factory in our internal and
external audits.
For all owned and finished-goods contractors, an independent third-party audit
team from an internationally recognized audit firm conducts an unannounced,
comprehensive factory assessment before production begins. Thereafter, the
audit process is repeated annually. These independent, third-party audits
include an initial management interview; facility and dormitory (if applicable)
tours; payroll analysis; confidential employee interviews that cover such
issues as working hours, payment practices, freedom of association, forced
labor, child labor and disciplinary practices; and a closing meeting with
management.Â  These audits use an objective, scored methodology and have over
260 separate questions. HanesBrands conducts over 500 audits/year using
external auditors and also has a team of over a dozen internal auditors around
the globe who work with facilities through the corrective action process.
(3) Certification by direct suppliers that materials incorporated into the
product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the
country or countries in which they are doing business.
HanesBrands expects all of its suppliers to act in a responsible manner, in
accordance with prevailing local and international legislation.Â  To ensure
that our suppliers live up to our values, our finished-goods suppliers are
required to sign a lengthy and comprehensive agreement which, among other
things, requires them to comply with all applicable laws (which include those
regarding slavery and human trafficking) and our GSS (described above). Our
suppliers of component materials and parts are also required via our purchase
order process to comply with our GSS and all applicable laws (which include
those regarding slavery and human trafficking).
(4) Internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or
contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and
trafficking.
HanesBrands maintains internal accountability standards and procedures
applicable to both employees and contractors who may fail to meet company
standards.Â  We work to continually develop and monitor our group policies and
procedures that are aimed at enhancing integrity and ethical behavior so that
they are consistent with good industry practice and properly reflect the
contemporary state of applicable law and regulation.
With regard to any issues identified in compliance audits of foreign
manufacturers, a formal corrective action plan is developed with specific
timeframes in which to correct the problems. Our internal audit teams around
the globe then visit these factories on an unannounced basis to confirm
adherence to the corrective action requirements. While we will typically
provide 30 to 90 days for factories to correct minor issues, we generally
consider things such as forced/prison labor, slavery, human trafficking, child
labor, physical/sexual abuse, and bribery of an auditor to be zero-tolerance
issues requiring immediate remediation or withdrawal from the facility,
depending on the circumstances.
Those facilities that are âdisapprovedâ for zero-tolerance or other
violations not remediated in a timely manner are noted on a companywide
âDisapproved Listâ that is routed to members of our senior management and
sourcing teams. Such facilities remain âdisapprovedâ for a minimum of one
year. We also closely track facilities on our internal âAlarm Listâ that
are not progressing adequately in the corrective-action process. The âAlarm
Listâ is also routed to appropriate members of our management team, so they
can exert the appropriate influence needed to spur timely corrective action.
(5) Training to company employees and management who have direct responsibility
for supply chain management on issues of human trafficking and slavery,
particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of
products.
We regularly conduct training on our GSS with our compliance and sourcing
staffs, as well as with our factory base. We also continually train all of our
own employees (over 65,000) on the requirements of our internal Global Code of
Conduct. We believe that a thorough understanding by all relevant individuals
of the requirements of these standards is critical to mitigating risks
associated with such critical issues as forced labor, slavery, human
trafficking and child labor.
