****** Transparency in the Supply Chain and Modern Slavery Statement ******
Modern Slavery Act 2015 and
Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

Burberry Group plc statement
This statement is made pursuant to Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015
and California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657). It sets out
the steps we have taken during the financial year 2018/19 (the âYearâ) to
prevent slavery and human trafficking from taking place in our supply chains or
in any part of our business.
This statement is also made on behalf of the following subsidiaries of Burberry
Group plc (company number 3458224); Burberry Limited (company number 162636),
Burberrys Limited (company number 230931), Burberry (UK) Limited (company
number 4288292), Burberry International Holdings Limited (company number
4251867), Burberry Europe Holdings Limited (company number 4458720), Thomas
Burberry Holdings Limited (company number 3509143), Burberry Haymarket Limited
(company number 4868493), Burberry Holdings Limited (company number 4251948)
and Burberry London Limited (company number 4251951) and the actions and
operations set out below  are effective across the Burberry group.
*** INTRODUCTION ***
As a global luxury retailer and manufacturer, with more than 10,000 employees,
431 retail stores and a supply chain touching the lives of thousands of people
worldwide, we believe in being socially and environmentally responsible.
Burberry has had social and environmental programmes in place for more than a
decade. These programmes, which cover our operations, our supply chain and
extend to the communities around us, are designed to drive positive change and
build a more sustainable future through innovation and collaboration.
Combatting slavery and human trafficking are core to this agenda.
As part of our five-year responsibility strategy, we set ambitious goals for
2022, focused on addressing our most material social and environmental impacts,
while supporting the Burberry Foundation in fuelling innovation and
transforming the lives of people in our communities. This agenda supports the
aims of the Paris Climate Agreement as well as a number of the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals.
We published our third Modern Slavery Statement in June 2018 and over the past
year have continued to increase the depth and breadth of our ethical trading
programme, reviewing our policies, developing our due diligence efforts
upstream in our supply chain, delving deeper into our modern slavery risks and
continuing to collaborate with cross-industry groups, such as the Ethical
Trading Initiativeâs Modern Slavery Working Group and Business Against
Slavery Forum, to target modern slavery.
*** OUR BUSINESS AND SUPPLY CHAIN ***
We design, develop, make and sell luxury products under the Burberry brand and
our business model is focused on creating long term sustainable value for all
our stakeholders.
Innovation

Our design process begins at our headquarters in London, where our creative
teams work across womenswear, menswear, childrenswear and accessories. We also
collaborate with licensing partners to create our beauty and eyewear offering.
With customer desires and responsibility front of mind, we constantly innovate
to bring our designs to life with new materials, techniques and combinations to
remain at the forefront of fashion while driving positive environmental and
social impacts.
Production

We carefully source materials based on their quality and sustainability,
working closely with our network of suppliers to ensure we receive the highest-
quality materials and goods while supporting our partners to drive positive
social impact in their communities.
Distribution & Communication

We have a large global network of directly operated and franchise stores, and
our own e-commerce capability serves 44 countries. We also work with select
wholesale and licensing partners, including third-party digital providers, to
complement our distribution networks and provide a luxury experience for all
customers.
*** OUR SUPPLY CHAIN ***
Our supply chain network supports the productions of our apparel, accessories
products and our day-to-day business operations.
Apparel & Accessories

Finished products are manufactured at both company-owned facilities in the UK
and Italy, and by an external supplier network. A large proportion of our
finished goods production takes place in Europe, where Burberry has many long-
standing relationships, including some for more than 15 years. We believe that
these strong supplier relationships are key to ensuring continuous improvement
in supply chain working conditions and we work towards minimising supplier
turnover, where possible.
We have visibility of all finished goods manufacturing suppliers, their
subcontractors and supporting facilities, as well as mills, tanneries and trims
suppliers.
Raw Materials

We believe that the sustainability of suppliers within our raw material supply
chain Is key to ensuring overall responsible sourcing of our products.  
The key raw materials we use are cotton, leather and cashmere and we have a
strategy and targets to source these more sustainably. Further detail on our
raw material sourcing targets is available here.
This year, we continued to expand our responsibility programme to also include
the assessment of mills, tanneries and trim suppliers and their sub-
contractors, covering 70% of our raw material suppliers.
Licensees
We have granted two product category licences under the Burberry brand to third
parties, namely to Coty to produce beauty products and to Luxottica to produce
eyewear.

Our responsibility team works with Coty and Luxottica to ensure they apply
consistent standards which are aligned with those applied across the rest of
Burberryâs supply chain.
Business Operations

As a large global organisation, we have many other supply chain operations
across EMEIA, Americas and Asia Pacific related to general business operations,
including but not limited to retail stores, our website, offices, marketing and
transport. We continue to communicate our commitments and policies designed to
prevent forced, bonded and trafficked labour through our Responsible Business
Principles (the âPrinciplesâ). Further details are set out below.
From 2018/19, we are including our packaging, visual merchandising, repurposing
and recycling supply chains within our ethical trading programme, assessing
risk, completing audits when required and working with suppliers to implement
continuous improvement plans.
*** POLICIES ***

We believe that respect for human rights is integral to being a responsible
company. The prevention of forced, bonded and trafficked labour is a key
element of Burberryâs Human Rights Policy and Ethical Trading Code of
Conduct: Burberry_Policies.

To promote human rights across our direct and indirect business operations, we
require our network of business associates and extended supply chain to comply
with our Principles.
The Principles have been developed over a number of years. They have been
informed by our longstanding membership of the United Nations Global Compact
and the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), and are underpinned by the
International Bill of Human Rights and the Fundamental Conventions of the
International Labour Organization. The Principles apply to all our business
associates, which include, but are not limited to: finished goods suppliers,
raw material suppliers, non-stock suppliers, construction contractors,
licensees and franchisees.

Since 2016, the Principles have expressly addressed modern slavery risks.
Incorporation of the Principles into our contracts with business associates
ensures the provisions targeting modern slavery are also included. The
Principles are overseen by Burberryâs Ethics Committee, chaired by our
general counsel. The policies are monitored by our responsibility and supply
chain teams and enforced pursuant to the Burberry Non-Compliance Policy,
detailed below.

The Principles include Burberryâs Code of Ethical Business Principles, Anti-
Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and Global Environmental Policy, and the
following policies:
Ethical Trading Code of Conduct

This outlines requirements which all our business associates must uphold in
relation to their own employees and throughout their own supply chain. The code
includes, amongst other standards, the following requirements: that employment
is freely chosen, child labour is not used, freedom of association is respected
and no harsh or inhumane treatment occurs. 

The full Code of Conduct is available here: Burberry_Ethical_Trading_Code_of
Conduct.
Burberry Migrant Worker Policy
This is specifically intended to protect workers who may be vulnerable to
exploitation in the course of international migration. The Policy contains
requirements including, but not limited to, the prohibition of withholding
passports and similar documents and the levying of recruitment fees.
We are in the process of updating and recommunicating this policy to suppliers
to provide more guidance on implementation of the Dhaka Principles for
Migration with Dignity.

The full Migrant Worker Policy is available here: Burberry_Migrant_Worker
Policy.
Burberry Human Rights Policy
Burberryâs Human Rights Policy sets out our four key stakeholder groups â
our people, workers in our supply chain, our customers and our communities -
and the procedures we have put in place to protect and uphold human rights,
including mechanisms in place to address any instances of potential
infringement. The policy was developed with reference to the United Nations
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We assess human rights impacts
and monitor labour conditions in both our own operations and our supply chain
on a regular basis to ensure the policy is upheld.
This year we reviewed and updated the Human Rights Policy to include references
to the International Labour Organization (ILO) core conventions throughout and
our expectations of suppliers.
Further details of Burberryâs Human Rights Policy are available here:
Burberry_Human_Rights_Policy.
Responsible Sourcing Policy

This outlines Burberryâs commitment to responsible and sustainable business
principles throughout the supply chain, including at the sourcing stage of raw
materials. The policy outlines specific prohibited sourcing regions, where the
risk of modern slavery and other labour rights issues is recognised. For
example, the policy prohibits any sourcing of cotton from Uzbekistan,
Turkmenistan and Syria.
Further details of the Responsible Sourcing Policy are available here: Burberry
Responsible Sourcing Policy
Partner Non-Compliance Policy

Where breaches of our standards and policies are identified, Burberry
collaborates with local partners to find solutions to address the non-
compliance.  Where improvements are not made within a given time or there is an
unwillingness to address the issue, we may consider terminating a particular
business relationship. 
The policy is designed to allow partners a reasonable amount of time to rectify
any non-compliance with the Principles, to minimise any potential detrimental
impact on workersâ livelihoods, while always reserving the right to terminate
contracts and take any other legal action possible, depending on the nature of
the breach.
Further details of the Partner Non-Compliance Policy are available here:
Burberry_Partner_Non-Compliance_Policy
In addition to the Principles, Burberryâs Ways of Working provide a set of
guidelines which all employees must abide by, relating to a wide range of
matters including personal conduct and whistleblowing. Burberry employees,
contractors and agency workers across our operations, also have access to a
confidential whistleblowing hotline which ensures that there is always a way to
report issues if usual routes of escalation are unavailable or restricted.
We continue to implement additional risk management of our non-stock
procurement supply chain to gain more visibility of areas of greater risk, such
as labour suppliers globally and construction contractors. Suppliers are
required to take responsibility for the prevention of forced, bonded and
trafficked labour in their supply chain and certify that neither they nor any
of their affiliates, contractors or sub-contractors engage or have engaged in
any form of modern slavery. This year, we have increased the due diligence
conducted within our visual merchandising supply chain.
Compliance with the Principles is a requirement of doing business with
Burberry. Adherence to the Principles is included in contracts with suppliers.
Finished goods suppliers sign a letter of undertaking confirming, amongst other
matters, their commitment to the Principles and to cascade the Principles to
their suppliers. We work with our business associates to support their
compliance, and may act against those that do not demonstrate sufficient
commitment to the Principles or are in breach of them. In the event of a
business associate being found to be involved in modern slavery, we would first
act to help safeguard the affected workersâ wellbeing and then to support the
business associate with its remediation process including any actions to
identify and address root cause issues.
*** Governance ***
We continue to promote the management of modern slavery risks within Burberry
and externally. In October 2017, Burberry became a founding member of the
Business Against Slavery Forum alongside some of the UKâs largest companies.
As part of this, Burberryâs CEO, Marco Gobbetti shares intelligence and best
practice to help businesses identify, tackle and prevent slavery in their
supply chains.
We have a global responsibility team consisting of around 35 specialists in key
locations globally. Although ethical trading activities are coordinated by our
responsibility team, targets relating to working conditions in the supply chain
are owned by our supply chain and relevant sourcing teams. Burberry employees,
who are responsible for supply chain partner relationships and sourcing, also
have personal KPIs related to labour conditions, recognising the potential
impact of fair purchasing practices on labour conditions throughout our supply
chain.
Our ethical trading programme is supported and monitored internally by a number
of management committees. The Programme aims to ensure that the potential risks
to labour and human rights are considered at all appropriate levels and areas
of the business.
In the event that any labour or human rights risks are identified, the Chief
Supply Chain Officer will report on such issues to the Groupâs Risk
Committee, which meets at least three times a year. The Risk Committee is
chaired by the Chief Operating and Financial Officer, who sits on the Burberry
Group plc board. The Risk Committee reports into the Groupâs Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee is chaired by an independent non-executive member of the
Board.
Additionally, our ethical trading targets and sustainability strategy are
reviewed by the Burberry Responsibility Advisory Committee (BRAC), which
includes representation from international Non-Governmental Organisations
(NGOs) Forum for the Future and Oxfam. The BRAC provides a third-party
perspective on our programmes to help determine whether we are focusing our
actions and resources on the most salient labour rightsâ risks throughout our
operations.
*** DUE DILIGENCE & ASSESSMENT OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN ***
Over the last 15 years, we have had a programme aimed at monitoring the labour
conditions in our product supply chains and safeguarding the workers engaged in
that supply chain.
Monitoring and verification activities are carried out throughout our finished
goods and key raw material supply chains to support compliance with the
Principles. To ensure our supply chain mapping stays up to date, we operate a
strict approval process and conduct a transparency analysis with our vendors
and commercial teams each season. Following this analysis, we conduct an
assessment to identify any new or emerging areas of risk.
New raw material suppliers are required to confirm they will adhere to the
Principles and comply with applicable local laws. They agree that we may visit
and assess their own compliance and that of their suppliers. Before any new
supplier is approved to participate in the Burberry supply chain, they are risk
assessed for social compliance and any indication of forced, bonded or
trafficked labour. If during this risk assessment a vulnerable workforce or
geographical location risk is identified, a full audit will be completed and
the results and the remediation plans (if any) will be evaluated before a
decision on whether or not to approve is taken.
In addition, before a factory is approved to produce Burberry finished goods,
we assess its compliance with the Principles and applicable local laws and
commitment to uphold them. The responsibility team must be satisfied that the
factory will uphold these standards before giving approval for production to
begin. Audits, announced or unannounced, consist of worker interviews, document
reviews and site tours, and are repeated periodically to confirm ongoing
compliance and continuous improvement. The frequency of audits depends on the
level of performance in previous audits â better performing factories are
audited less frequently. Worker interviews are always conducted confidentially
and workers are selected at random with fair representation of the workforce,
including, for example, union and worker representatives, first aiders and
migrant workers. Our audit methodology prescribes that we interview at least
10% of the workers in a factory. Between audits, our Responsibility Team works
closely with facilities to implement systems to prevent modern slavery and
improve the management of human rights and safety risks, amongst others. During
the period 2018/19, we conducted 481 audits and 221 engagement visits.
*** ASSESSING OUR HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACT ***
Every two years, we conduct a Human Rights Impact Assessment of our operations
and activities and those of our extended supply chain to identify and address
potential risks. This year, we are engaging representatives of affected
stakeholder groups to develop informed mitigation action plans.
We have implemented a number of action plans in both our direct operations and
supply chain, including a focus on migrant workers and women throughout the
different levels of our supply chain as we identified that these groups are
more vulnerable to modern slavery risk. Action plans include context specific
interventions such as mapping recruitment journeys in identified hotspots,
building worker voice mechanisms in these areas and working with experts to
integrate gender sensitive processes and metrics into our programmes.

After the 2016 assessment, we expanded our ethical trading assessments to cover
select construction projects and all distribution and fulfilment centres
globally. From 2018/2019 we have been assessing the repurposing and recycling
facilities we work with as recycling facilities in particular can rely on a
large contingent labour workforce.

Other areas identified in the 2018/19 assessment include recruitment practices
in all owned and third-party distribution centres globally, promotion of access
to remedy in our key supply chain locations, and upholding of labour rights in
our raw material supply chains. Where we have identified a salient forced
labour risk in our raw material supplier facilities, ethical trading
assessments are conducted by our internal teams or by a local NGO, where local
expertise is needed, to identify any labour rights issues and remediation
required.
Further details on our Human Rights Impact Assessment are available here:
Burberry_Human_Rights_Impact_Assessment.
Monitoring alone does not drive improvements in labour conditions and therefore
we have several programmes in place to support our supply chain partners to
improve labour conditions:
*** WORKER GRIEVANCE MECHANISM ***
Labour rights issues can include inadequate access to remedy. Where this
occurs, we work with local NGOs to establish a hotline to share information
with workers on their labour rights, create a mechanism to report grievances
and provide psychological support.
The effectiveness of the hotline is frequently reviewed and, during 2018/19,
572 calls (20 complaints, 504 consulting requests and 48 psychological support
requests) were received. Resolutions were monitored closely by our local
responsibility teams.
We continue to review access to remedy and we will extend the hotline where
required, prioritising suppliers with migrant workers.
*** WORKER WELLBEING ***
We continue to work on programmes to capture comments and grievances from
workers in our supply chain globally and address issues raised.

We have used the tool we developed with Oxfam to measure worker wellbeing in
our supply chain and capture comments and feedback from workers with
approximately 1,400 workers across eight facilities globally.
The results have been used to develop specific action plans for each factory.
To date, these action plans have focused on the development of HR management
systems, worker and supervisor training programmes and policy implementation.
*** CHAMPIONING DIVERSITY AND ENSURING INCLUSIVITY ***
Following this yearâs Human Rights Impact Assessment, we have created a
theory of change and programme plan for migrant workers within our supply
chain, focused on ensuring fair treatment, no discrimination and ensuring
workers can flourish both at work and in their environment.
We have mapped particular risk areas and are working closely with local expert
organisations and our suppliers to develop roadmaps to mitigate risk to
domestic and international migrant workers in key supply chain locations.
*** TRAINING & RESOURCES ***
Our responsibility team includes specialists on labour and human rights and
modern slavery. All Burberry employees are introduced to Burberryâs corporate
responsibility policies Our responsibility team includes specialists on labour
and human rights and modern slavery. All Burberry employees are introduced to
Burberryâs corporate responsibility policies and programmes during their
induction training to ensure a general understanding of Burberryâs
responsibilities in this area.

Informed by Burberryâs Human Rights Impact Assessment, we developed a bespoke
modern slavery and labour rights training programme in collaboration with the
ethical trade, human rights and labour standards consultancy, Impactt. The
training has been delivered to key employee groups who interact with
Burberryâs supply chain networks. The targeted training helps those
travelling to supply chain facilities to be familiar with the risk areas,
likely indications of human rights abuses (including instances of modern
slavery) and possible actions to take if an incident of modern slavery is
identified. In addition, we have trained members of our human resources, health
and safety, construction and fulfilment teams on modern slavery, how to
identify it and appropriate actions to take. This training has helped embed
respect for human rights and a policy of zero tolerance for modern slavery
throughout the business. An ongoing training programme will deliver updated
training to relevant employee groups globally.

In 2016/17, we provided tailored training to suppliers on identifying and
combatting modern slavery. In-person training sessions were held with finished
goods vendors who together manufacture 72% of our products. Initially, this
training was provided to key finished goods and raw material suppliers, third-
party labour contractors and certain suppliers operating in sectors with a
greater risk of modern slavery issues arising. Participants were required to
develop and implement plans around the recruitment and ongoing management of
workers to reduce the risk of modern slavery in their operations and supply
chain. These plans continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis by our
responsibility team.
In 2018/19, our UK responsibility team completed an âInvestigative
Interviewing Skillsâ course developed and delivered by the Gangmasters Labour
Abuse Authority and Stronger Togther. The skills learned will be deployed as
part of our ethical trading audit methodology.
*** KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS ***
We monitor the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) set out below on an ongoing
basis. These KPIs help us ensure the effectiveness of our efforts to address
modern slavery risks and are continually reviewed.
*** INTERNAL TRAINING ***
We have trained 112 employees from teams working with our business and product
supply chains. Teams completing the training include Sourcing, Product
Development, HR, Legal, Construction, Procurement and Workplace Services.
In 2019/20, the sourcing and product teams will receive refresher training.
*** SUPPLY CHAIN TRAINING ***
We have trained finished goods suppliers, their key subcontractors and key raw
material suppliers on the identification of modern slavery and building systems
to prevent the occurrence of modern slavery.
*** WORKER VOICE ***
We continue to implement initiatives to strengthen workersâ access to
information and the ability to raise grievances as well as to measure worker
wellbeing.
In 2018/2019, Burberryâs worker hotline received 572 calls, categorised as 20
complaints, 504 consulting requests and 48 psychological support requests.
We also surveyed approximately 1,400 workers across 8 facilities globally to
build a better understanding of workersâ wellbeing and identify opportunities
for improvement. In the coming year, we will use these results to improve the
KPIs we review across facilities.
*** AUDITS & ASSESSMENTS ***
In 2018/19, we conducted 481 audits and 221 engagement visits or training
sessions.The majority of these activities were conducted by our internal
responsibility team who endeavour to build trust in our ongoing partnerships
and drive continuous improvement.
The audit and assessment programme covers all our finished goods facilities and
their subcontractor supply chains, and 70% of our raw material supplier mills,
tanneries and trim or component facilities.
Through this yearâs audits of the product and licensee supply chains, we have
identified instances at 9 facilities where workers have paid fees for
recruitment. We have worked with facility management to ensure workers were
refunded. We also identified two facilities where management was holding worker
passports. Both instances were resolved within a few days and workersâ
identity documentation returned. To prevent future issues, we continue to re-
communicate policies, review recruitment journeys of migrant workers and
develop fee-free recruitment chains.
*** LOOKING AHEAD ***
We continue to strengthen the breadth and depth of our ethical trading
programme and implement the action plans resulting from our 2018 Human Rights
Impact Assessment. We believe that our continuing focus on transparency and
traceability throughout the supply chain can help identify modern slavery risks
which can then be addressed.

We continue to review own business operations and procurement procedures to
ensure that risks of modern slavery are considered.

Should any instances of modern slavery be identified, we believe we are well
positioned to address these and to support any affected workers in line with
our core values.
