Tapestry, Inc. Disclosure
Tapestry products and major supplier relationships are governed by the Tapestry
Supplier Code of Conduct (âSupplier Code of Conductâ) which includes an
absolute prohibition on forced or bonded labor. In this disclosure, we explain
in detail how we apply our Supplier Code of Conduct in practice through good
governance practices.
In compliance with the UK Act, this document covers the reporting period of 30
June 2018 to 29 June 2019. This information may also apply to past endeavors
undertaken by Tapestry.
Tapestry has adopted the following broad definition of slavery: âa person who
is forced to work, without pay, under threat of violence, who cannot walk
away,â as defined by the international non-governmental organization Free the
Slaves (seeÂ http://www.freetheslaves.net/about-slavery/faqs-glossary/).
Tapestry has adopted the following broad definition of human trafficking:
âany recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision or obtaining of a
person for labor services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the
purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage or
slaveryâ as defined in the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protections
Act of 2000.
Tapestry assesses our risk of slavery and human trafficking as low for the
following reasons:
   1. Verification of Product Supply Chain:Tapestry verifies its product supply
      chain by conducting audits of the service providers and key raw material
      providers with which we do business to ensure compliance with our
      Supplier Code of Conduct and other corporate guidelines, including the
      policies under Tapestryâs Global Business Integrity Program. We ensure
      we know the exact sites where our brandsâ products are manufactured.
      Both human trafficking and slavery fall within our Supplier Code of
      Conductâs definition of âforced laborâ and, as such, are strictly
      prohibited, at all stages of the product supply chain.
   2. Conducts Audits of Suppliers:Tapestry conducts two types of supplier
      audits: audits by Tapestry employees and independent third party audits.
      Third party auditors routinely undertake unannounced visits to the
      locations where Tapestry brandsâ products are manufactured and provide
      Tapestry with full reports on the living and working conditions of the
      people retained to work at those locations.
   3. Requirement for suppliers to certify compliance:Tapestry receives
      certifications from direct suppliers regarding their compliance with
      Tapestryâs standards for employment – including a certification on the
      part of the supplier that all materials sourced for and incorporated into
      Tapestry products comply with slavery and trafficking laws of the country
      or countries where the supplier is doing business.
   4. Maintains internal accountability standards:Â Tapestry has developed a
      Supplier Code of Conduct for all parties working with Tapestry or its
      brands – as embodied in the Global Business Integrity Program.In the case
      of non-compliance, Tapestry reserves the right to examine the specific
      situation and develop a strategy for resolution. If non-compliance is not
      resolved within a designated time frame, Tapestry may terminate a
      business relationship. Additionally, the Company operates an ethics and
      compliance reporting system (1-800-396-1807 or
      www.tapestry.ethicspoint.com), where employees, suppliers, consumers and
      other interested parties can report issues with and deviations from
      Tapestryâs principles and policies.
   5. Conducts Training:Â Tapestry conducts internal trainings of its employees
      to ensure that participants in supply chain management are knowledgeable
      and aware of the issues and concerns surrounding the supply chain,
      including human trafficking and slavery, with a particular focus on
      mitigating risks. Tapestry also conducts supplier trainings to ensure
      that our suppliers understand our Supplier Code of Conduct and the
      companyâs expectations. Tapestryâs last supplier training took place
      in June 2019.
Our Effectiveness in Combating Slavery and Human Trafficking
We use the following metrics to measure how effective we have been to ensure
that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our business or
supply chains:
    * completion of audits of our suppliersâ facilities by Tapestry personnel
      or a designated third party, reported on annually in our Corporate
      Responsibility Report at www.tapestry.com/responsibility;
    * use of labor monitoring and payroll systems to check eligibility of
      employees in our owned and leased UK operations; and
    * number of suppliers trained annually on our corporate policies and
      expectations, with special emphasis on human trafficking and modern
      slavery.
Looking Ahead
Tapestry will continue to assess its business and supply chains to identify
potential risks and target those areas with policies, procedures and trainings
to ensure it maintains appropriate safeguards against the mistreatment of
persons.
Approved by the Board on 8 August 2019 as applicable to Tapestry, Inc. and its
subsidiaries during fiscal year 2019.
