INTRODUCTION
As a global luxury retailer and manufacturer, with more than 10,000 employees, 431 retail stores and a
supply chain touching the lives of thousands of people worldwide, we believe in being socially and
environmentally responsible.
Burberry has had social and environmental programmes in place for more than a decade. These
programmes, which cover our operations, our supply chain and extend to the communities around us, are
designed to drive positive change and build a more sustainable future through innovation and
collaboration. Combatting slavery and human tra icking are core to this agenda.
As part of our ive-year responsibility strategy, we set ambitious goals for 2022, focused on addressing
our most material social and environmental impacts, while supporting the Burberry Foundation in fuelling
innovation and transforming the lives of people in our communities. This agenda supports the aims of the
Paris Climate Agreement as well as a number of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
We published our third Modern Slavery Statement in June 2018 and over the past year have continued to
increase the depth a nd brea dth of o ur ethical tra ding progra mme, revi ewing o ur policies, dev eloping

We have a large global network of directly operated and franchise stores, and our own e-commerce
capability serves 44 countries, We also work with select wholesale and licensing partners, including thirdparty digital providers, to complement our distribution networks and provide a luxury experience for all
customers.

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
Our supply chain network supports the productions of our apparel and accessories products, and our dayto-day business operations.
Apparel & Accessories
Finished products are manufactured at both company-owned facilities in the UK and Italy, and by an
external supplier network. A large proportion of our inished goods production takes place in Europe,
where Burberry has many long-standing relationships, including some for more than 15 years. We believe
that these strong supplier relationships are key to ensuring continuous improvement in supply chain
working conditions and we work towards minimising supplier turnover, where possible.
We have visibility of all inished goods manufacturing suppliers, their subcontractors and supporting
facilities, as well as mills, tanneries and trims suppliers.
Raw Materials
We believe that the sustainability of suppliers within our raw material supply chain is key to ensuring
overall responsible sourcing of our products.
The key raw materials we use are cotton, leather and cashmere and we have a strategy and targets to
source these more sustainably. Further detail on our raw material sourcing targets is available here:
Burberry Product Strategy.
This year, we continued to expand our responsibility programme to also include the assessment of mills,
tanneries and trim suppliers and their sub-contractors, covering 70% of our raw material suppliers.

Business Operations
As a large global organisation, we have many other supply chain operations across EMEIA, Americas and
Asia Paci ic related to ge neral business operations, including but not limited to retail stores, our website,
o ices, marketing and transport. We continue to communicate our commitments and policies designed to
prevent forced, bonded and tra icked labour through our Responsible Bus iness Principles (the "Principles

From 2018/19, we are including our packaging, visual merchandising, repurposing and recy c ling s upply
chains within our ethical trading programme, assess ing ris k, completing audits when required and
working with suppliers to implement continuous improvement plans.

POLICIES
We believe that respect for human rights is integral to being a responsible company. The prevention of
forced, bonded and tra icked labour is a key element of Burberry's Human Rights Policy and Ethical
Trading Code of Conduct: Burberry Policies.
To promote human rights across our direct and indirect business operations, we require our network of
business associates and extended supply chain to comply with our Principles.
The Principles have been developed over a number of years. They have been informed by our longstanding
membership of the United Nations Global Compact and the Ethical Trading Initiative (Ell), and are
underpinned by the International Bill of Human Rights and the Fundamental Conventions of the
International Labour Organization. The Principles apply to all our business associates, which include, but
are not limited to: inished goods suppliers, raw material suppliers, non-stock suppliers, construction
contractors, licensees and franchisees.
Since 2016, the Principles have expressly addressed modern slavery risks. Incorporation of the Principles
into our contracts with business associates ensures the provisions targeting modern slavery are also
included. The Principles are overseen by Burberry’s Ethics Committee, chaired by our general counsel. The

Policy and Global Environmental Policy, and the following policies:
Ethical Trading Code of Conduct
This outlines requirements which all our business associates must uphold in relation to their own
employees and throughout their own supply chain. The code includes, amongst other standards, the
following requirements: that employment is freely chosen, child labour is not used, freedom of association
is respected and no harsh or inhumane treatment occurs.
The full Code of Conduct is available here: Burberry Ethical Trading Code of Conduct.
Burberry Migrant Worker Policy
This is speci ically intended to protect workers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the course of
international migration. The Policy contains requirements including, but not limited to, the prohibition of
withholding passports and similar documents and the levying of recruitment fees.
We are in the process of updating and recommunicating this policy to suppliers to provide more guidance
on implementation of the Dhaka Principles for Migration with Dignity.
The full Migrant Worker Policy is available here: Burberry Migrant Worker Policy.
Burberry Human Rights Policy
Burberry’s Human Rights Policy sets out our four key stakeholder groups – our people, workers in our
supply chain, our customers and our communities - and the procedures we have put in place to protect
and uphold human rights, including mechanisms in place to address any instances of potential
infringement. The policy was developed with reference to the United Nations Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights. We assess human rights impacts and monitor labour conditions in both our
own operations and our supply chain on a regular basis to ensure the policy is upheld.
This year we reviewed and updated the Human Rights Policy to include references to the International
Labour Organization (ILO) core conventions throughout and our expectations of suppliers.

Partner Non-Compliance Policy
Where breaches of our standards and policies are identi ied, Burberry collaborates with local partners to
ind solutions to address the non- compliance. Where improvements are not made within a given time or
there is an unwillingness to address the issue, we may consider terminating a particular business
relationship.
The policy is designed to allow partners a reasonable amount of time to rectify any non- compliance with
the Principles, to minimise any potential detrimental impact on workers’ livelihoods, while always
reserving the right to terminate contracts and take any other legal action possible, depending on the
nature of the breach.
Further details of the Partner Non-Compliance Policy are available here: Burberry Partner NonCompliance Policy
In addition to the Principles, Burberry’s Ways of Working provide a set of guidelines which all employees
must abide by, relating to a wide range of matters including personal conduct and whistleblowing.
Burberry employees, contractors and agency workers across our operations, also have access to a
con idential whistleblowing hotline which ensures that there is always a way to report issues if usual
routes of escalation are unavailable or restricted.
We continue to implement additional risk management of our non-stock procurement supply chain to gain
more visibility of areas of greater risk, such as labour suppliers globally and construction contractors.
Suppliers are required to take responsibility for the prevention of forced, bonded and tra icked labour in
their supply chain and certify that neither they nor any of their a iliates, contractors or sub-contractors
engage or have engaged in any form of modern slavery. This year, we have increased the due diligence
conducted within our visual merchandising supply chain.
Compliance with the Principles is a requirement of doing business with Burberry. Adherence to the
Principles is included in contracts with suppliers. Finished goods suppliers sign a letter of undertaking
con irming, amongst other matters, their commitment to the Principles and to cascade the Principles to
their suppliers. We work with our business associates to support their compliance, and may act against

GOVERNANCE
We continue to promote the management of modern slavery risks within Burberry and externally. In
October 2017, Burberry became a founding member of the Business Against Slavery Forum alongside
some of the UK’s largest companies. As part of this, Burberry’s CEO, Marco Gobbetti shares intelligence
and best practice to help businesses identify, tackle and prevent slavery in their supply chains.
We have a global responsibility team consisting of around 35 specialists in key locations globally. Although
ethical trading activities are coordinated by our responsibility team, targets relating to working conditions
in the supply chain are owned by our supply chain and relevant sourcing teams. Burberry employees, who
are responsible for supply chain partner relationships and sourcing, also have personal KPIs related to
labour conditions, recognising the potential impact of fair purchasing practices on labour conditions
throughout our supply chain.
Our ethical trading programme is supported and monitored internally by a number of management
committees. The Programme aims to ensure that the potential risks to labour and human rights are
considered at all appropriate levels and areas of the business.
In the event that any labour or human rights risks are identi ied, the Chief Supply Chain O icer will report
on such issues to the Group’s Risk Committee, which meets at least three times a year. The Risk
Committee is chaired by the Chief Operating and Financial O icer, who sits on the Burberry Group plc
board. The Risk Committee reports into the Group’s Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is chaired by
an independent non-executive member of the Board.
Additionally, our ethical trading targets and sustainability strategy are reviewed by the Burberry
Responsibility Advisory Committee (BRAC), which includes representation from international NonGovernmental Organisations (NGOs) Forum for the Future and Oxfam. The BRAC provides a third-party
perspective on our programmes to help determine whether we are focusing our actions and resources on
the most salient labour rights’ risks throughout our operations.

supply chains to support compliance with the Principles. To ensure our supply chain mapping stays up to
date, we operate a strict approval process and conduct a transparency analysis with our vendors and
commercial teams each season. Following this analysis, we conduct an assessment to identify any new or
emerging areas of risk.
New raw material suppliers are required to con irm they will adhere to the Principles and comply with
applicable local laws. They agree that we may visit and assess their own compliance and that of their
suppliers. Before any new supplier is approved to participate in the Burberry supply chain, they are risk
assessed for social compliance and any indication of forced, bonded or tra icked labour. If during this risk
assessment a vulnerable workforce or geographical location risk is identi ied, a full audit will be completed
and the results and theremediation plans (if any) will be evaluated before a decision on whether or not to
approve is taken.
In addition, before a factory is approved to produce Burberry inished goods, we assess its compliance
with the Principles and applicable local laws and commitment to uphold them. The responsibility team
must be satis ied that the factory will uphold these standards before giving approval for production to
begin. Audits, announced or unannounced, consist of worker interviews, document reviews and site tours,
and are repeated periodically to con irm ongoing compliance and continuous improvement. The frequency
of audits depends on the level of performance in previous audits – better performing factories are audited
less frequently. Worker interviews are always conducted con identially and workers are selected at
random with fair representation of the workforce, including, for example, union and worker
representatives, irst aiders and migrant workers. Our audit methodology prescribes that we interview at
least 10% of the workers in a factory. Between audits, our Responsibility Team works closely with
facilities to implement systems to prevent modern slavery and improve the management of human rights
and safety risks, amongst others. During the period 2018/19, we conducted 481 audits and 221
engagement visits.

ASSESSING OUR HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACT
Every two years, we conduct a Human Rights Impact Assessment of our operations and activities and
those of our extended supply chain to identify and address potential risks. This year, we are engaging
representatives of a fected stakeholder groups to develop informed mitigation action plans.
We have implemented a number of action plans in both our direct operations and supply chain, including a
focus on migrant workers and women throughout the di ferent levels of our supply chain as we identi ied

After the 2016 assessment, we expanded our ethical trading assessments to cover select construction
projects and all distribution and ful ilment centres globally. From 2018/2019 we have been assessing the
repurposing and recycling facilities we work with as recycling facilities in particular can rely on a large
contingent labour workforce.
Other areas identi ied in the 2018/19 assessment include recruitment practices in all owned and thirdparty distribution centres globally, promotion of access to remedy in our key supply chain locations, and
upholding of labour rights in our raw material supply chains. Where we have identi ied a salient forced
labour risk in our raw material supplier facilities, ethical trading assessments are conducted by our
internal teams or by a local NGO, where local expertise is needed, to identify any labour rights issues and
remediation required.

Monitoring alone does not drive improvements in labour conditions and therefore we have several
programmes in place to support our supply chain partners to improve labour conditions:

WORKER GRIEVANCE MECHANISM
Labour rights issues can include inadequate access to remedy. Where this occurs, we work with local
NGOs to establish a hotline to share information with workers on their labour rights, create a mechanism
to report grievances and provide psychological support.
The e fectiveness of the hotline is frequently reviewed and, during 2018/19, 572 calls (20 complaints, 504
consulting requests and 48 psychological support requests) were received. Resolutions were monitored
closely by our local responsibility teams.
We continue to review access to remedy and we will extend the hotline where required, prioritising
suppliers with migrant workers.

Following this year’s Human Rights Impact Assessment, we have created a theory of change and

We have mapped particular risk areas and are working closely with local expert organisations and our

TRAINING & RESOURCES
Our responsibility team includes specialists on labour and human rights and modern slavery. All Burberry
employees are introduced to Burberry’s corporate responsibility policies and programmes during their
induction training to ensure a general understanding of Burberry’s responsibilities in this area.
Informed by Burberry’s Human Rights Impact Assessment, we developed a bespoke modern slavery and
labour rights training programme in collaboration with the ethical trade, human rights and labour
standards consultancy, Impactt. The training has been delivered to key employee groups who interact with
Burberry’s supply chain networks. The targeted training helps those travelling to supply chain facilities to
be familiar with the risk areas, likely indications of human rights abuses (including instances of modern
slavery) and possible actions to take if an incident of modern slavery is identi ied. In addition, we have
trained members of our human resources, health and safety, construction and ful ilment teams on modern
slavery, how to identify it and appropriate actions to take. This training has helped embed respect for
human rights and a policy of zero tolerance for modern slavery

person training sessions were held with inished goods vendors who together manufacture 72% of our
products. Initially, this training was provided to key inished goods and raw material suppliers, third-party
labour contractors and certain suppliers operating in sectors with a greater risk of modern slavery issues
arising. Participants were required to develop and implement plans around the recruitment and ongoing
management of workers to reduce the risk of modern slavery in their operations and supply chain. These
plans continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis by our responsibility team.
In 2018/19, our UK responsibility team completed an “Investigative Interviewing Skills” course developed
and delivered by the Gangmasters Labour Abuse Authority and Stronger Togther. The skills learned will be
deployed as part of our ethical trading audit methodology.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
We monitor the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) set out below on an ongoing basis. These KPIs help us
ensure the e fectiveness of our e forts to address modern slavery risks and are continually reviewed.

INTERNAL TRAINING
We have trained 112 employees from teams working with our business and product supply chains. Teams
completing the training include Sourcing, Product Development, HR, Legal, Construction, Procurement

In 2018/19, we conducted 481 audits and 221 engagement visits or training sessions. The majority of these
activities were conducted by our internal responsibility team who endeavour to build trust in our ongoing
partnerships and drive continuous improvement.
The audit and assessment programme covers all our inished goods facilities and their subcontractor
supply chains, and 70% of our raw material supplier mills, tanneries and trim or component facilities.
Through this year’s audits of the product and licensee supply chains, we have identi ied instances at 9
facilities where workers have paid fees for recruitment. We have worked with facility management to
ensure workers were refunded. We also identi ied two facilities where management was holding worker
passports. Both instances were resolved within a few days and workers’ identity documentation returned.
To prevent future issues, we continue to re-communicate policies, review recruitment journeys of migrant
workers and develop fee-free recruitment chains.

LOOKING AHEAD
We continue to strengthen the breadth and depth of our ethical trading programme and implement the
action plans resulting from our 2018 Human Rights Impact Assessment. We believe that our continuing
focus on transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain can help identify modern slavery risks
which can then be addressed.
We continue to review own business operations and procurement procedures to ensure that risks of
modern slavery are considered.
Should any instances of modern slavery be identi ied, we believe we are well positioned to address these
and to support any a fected workers in line with our core values.
