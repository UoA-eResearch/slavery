MODERN SLAVERY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN STATEMENT
AIRWAIR INTERNATIONAL’S
STANCE ON MODERN SLAVERY
At Dr. Martens, we do not accept
modern slavery. We state in our
code of conduct that employment
must be freely chosen without
any form of forced labour, prison
labour, or bonded labour. We are
committed to taking all necessary
steps to identify, investigate,
engage and remediate any
issues uncovered.
This statement is made pursuant to
Section 54 of the Modern
Slavery Act 2015 and California
Transparency in Supply Chains Act

the actions we have undertaken to
understand the potential modern
slavery risks related to our business,
the steps and measures we have put
in place to mitigate against modern
slavery in our own business and our
supply chains, as well as some of
the additional work that we plan to
do. This statement covers the
activities between October 2016
and October 2017.

OUR ORGANISATION

WHAT IS ‘MODERN SLAVERY’?

AirWair International Ltd. is a
footwear brand that was established
in Wollaston, UK in 1960, and has
had a manufacturing unit there ever
since. This year we opened our new
global head office, and home to the
brand, in Camden, London.

The Ethical Trade Initiative refers
to modern slavery as an umbrella
term that includes: forced labour,
bonded labour, human trafficking
and slavery. The term “modern”
is used to distinguish the
complexity of today’s slavery
from historical slavery associated
with the legal possession of one
person by another.

AirWair International Ltd is part
of the Dr. Martens Airwair Group
Ltd group of companies which has
subsidiaries in the US, Hong Kong,
Japan, Korea, France, Belgium and
the Netherlands, as well as a wholly
owned foreign enterprise in China.
Dr. Martens’ footwear, clothing and
accessories products are sold in
more than 70 owned stores or via
wholesale and online both in the UK
and internationally.

OUR EMPLOYEES
As of 2017 we have around 1200
employees globally, the majority of
which are in offices and stores, with
some working in warehouses.
We recruit and select all of our own
employees and determine the terms
and conditions of their employment.
Our employees are free to decide
whether they work for us and if they
accept the terms and conditions.
As part of our recruitment process
we undertake checks locally on all
employees to verify their identity, age
and eligibility to work in that country.
In certain areas of our business we
sometimes use temporary labour to
help manage seasonal peaks in workload (for example in our distribution
centres in the UK and US). We occasionally use carefully selected third
party recruitment agencies to provide
this labour under pre-agreed terms.

MODERN SLAVERY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN STATEMENT P1

Our business and our supply chain,
like many others in our industry,
has multiple tiers reaching across
continents and countries. Modern
slavery is a global issue within these
complex business models and supply
chains.

MODERN SLAVERY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN STATEMENT
OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
WHERE WE PRODUCE AND
SOURCE OUR PRODUCTS
(1ST TIER SUPPLIERS)
We are a manufacturing brand which
owns and operates a footwear factory in the UK. We also source finished
footwear, clothing and accessories
from factories in China, Thailand,
Vietnam, Lao, Philippines, Portugal
and the UK.
Our key strategy in sourcing our
products is to establish long-term
relationships with our partners in
these countries, in many cases we
have built up a relationship over
many years. More than 75% of our
sourcing spend comes from factories
we have worked with for more than
10 years. This allows us to have a
deeper understanding of the issues
our suppliers face and creates an
environment of trust, transparency
and collaboration in improving the
workplace standards.
COMPONENT SUPPLY CHAIN
(2ND TIER SUPPLIERS)
We also work directly with a large
number of our second tier material
and component suppliers, such us
leather and textiles, across Asia,
Europe and South America. Where
possible these are nominated by us
so we can have better control of the
materials used in our products.
We are members of the Leather
Working Group (LWG) whose aim is
to raise environmental standards
throughout the industry and to
develop best practices. The majority
of our upper leather was sourced
from nominated LWG medal status
tanneries where we can monitor the
environmental standards.

In addition to environmental
topics in the nominated tanneries,
this year we undertook a detailed
survey to better understand our
non-nominated second tier material
and component suppliers. We are
now expanding our CSR program to
include the second tier factories’
social standards.

+ Working conditions are safe
and hygienic

SERVICE CONTRACTORS

+ No harsh or inhumane treatment
is allowed

We purchase services, consumables,
marketing materials from various
contractors. We are in the process of
mapping and assessing the risk of
the supply chain of our operations
in our headquarters and regions.
While we continue mapping, we have
introduced a Modern Slavery clause
in our new contract agreements.

OUR COMMITMENTS
AND POLICIES
+ Supplier Code of Conduct

+ Child labour shall not be used
+ Living wages are paid
+ Working hours are not excessive
+ No discrimination is practised
+ Regular employment is provided

To provide further guidance to our
suppliers we have added some
additional information to our Code of
Conduct on what constitutes modern
slavery/forced labour.
All of our policies are issued to our
first tier footwear suppliers on an
annual basis for them to review,
acknowledge and confirm
compliance. In 2017 we extended
these policies to non-footwear
suppliers.

+ Anti-slavery and human
trafficking policy

ANTI-SLAVERY AND HUMAN
TRAFFICKING POLICY

+ Subcontracting and
homeworking policy

To ensure that our own employees
are aware of the risks of modern
slavery and their obligations under
the Modern Slavery Act, we have
developed an Anti-Slavery and
Human Trafficking Policy. In 2016
and 2017 we provided training to
our key employees on the details of
this policy. Alongside this work we
will also be ensuring that all of our
employees have received a copy of
our whistleblowing policy that can
be used as a mechanism to raise any
concerns in relation to suspected
breaches of our policy.

SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT
Our suppliers must adhere to and
are audited upon our supplier
Code of Conduct which has been in
place since 2006 and has been
updated over the years to reflect
best practices. Our CSR Code of
Conduct is based on the Ethical
Trading Initiative Base Code
and covers the following areas:
+ Employment is freely chosen
+ Freedom of association and
the right to collective bargaining
are respected

MODERN SLAVERY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN STATEMENT P2

MODERN SLAVERY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN STATEMENT
Our staff in key sourcing countries
and headquarters have received
Modern Slavery awareness training
by a third party organisation
specialised in improving labour
conditions in global supply chains.
This training aimed to create
awareness on what constitutes
slavery in today’s world, especially
in manufacturing and retail business
environments.
SUBCONTRACTING AND
HOMEWORKING POLICY
One of the main risks in sourcing
from other countries is the use of
subcontracting and homeworking.
We have a policy in place with all of
our first tier footwear suppliers that
requires them to disclose any
potential subcontracting or
homeworking before going ahead so
that we can review the proposed site.
As we work closely with our
suppliers and understand their
production processes to a high level
of detail, and conduct regular CSR
audits, the risk of any subcontracting
or homeworking taking place without
our knowledge is reduced.
MIGRANT WORKER POLICY
Modern slavery in supply chains is
a growing issue globally and is
increased by the workforce
migration. Migrant workers are
more vulnerable because they are
unlikely to raise grievances with
their employers or the authorities –
especially if they are undocumented.
These are shared issues and require
collective and collaborative action
to be tackled. This year we have also
started to develop a migrant worker
policy to implement international
best practices addressing the issues
that migrant workers may face.

DUE DILIGENCE,
AUDITING AND
TRAINING IN PRODUCT
SUPPLY CHAIN

The training included:

A key part of our supply chain due
diligence and compliance is carrying
out detailed audits against our CSR
Code of Conduct at all of our first
tier footwear suppliers before and
during our relationship. These audits
have been in place for a number of
years now and we continue to
regularly conduct CSR audits.

+ Roles and responsibilities of
employees and staff

The audits are carried out by a third
party company which specialises
in this field and involve talking to
workers both on-site and off-site.
The audits are conducted by local
experts during several days to allow
detailed checks and verifications
through document reviews and
worker and management interviews.
Alongside our CSR audit program, we
have our own Sourcing and Quality
team based in Asia, which allows
us to visit all of our first tier and
most of our second tier suppliers in
person on a regular basis. This again
gives us invaluable insight into our
supplier factories practices including
potential issues relating to modern
slavery.
In 2016 these teams were trained on
Modern Slavery, how to detect it in
the supply chain context and what
steps to take if a potential issue is
identified.

MODERN SLAVERY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN STATEMENT P3

+ Introduction to Modern Slavery,
including the law and in practice
+ The spectrum of Modern Slavery

+ Worker vulnerabilities
+ Key issues for members of
commercial teams to spot when
visiting factories.
Most of the countries and regions
we are operating in have been part
of our supply chain for a number of
years, so we believe we understand
the risks that are present and we can
immediately work with the suppliers
for remediation.
When we move to a new country/
region or become aware of any significant changes to our supply chain,
we undertake activities to assess
potential risks, including:
+ Preliminary assessment visits
+ Desk-based research
+ Consultation with relevant third
parties
+ Full audit prior to commencing bulk
production
+ Ongoing monitoring, depending on
the outcome of the previous audit
result.

WHAT’S NEXT
We are committed to keep our focus
on the continuous improvement of
our approach to Modern Slavery.
Next year we will take the following
steps to continue to meet this
important commitment.
+ Footwear is our main product,
however, we also sell leather
accessories and some clothing
items. We plan to extend our
CSR assessments in all the nonfootwear factories to get a better
understanding of the labor
standards and working
conditions.
+ We are increasing our resources
in Asia to start assessing our 		
second tier suppliers to 		
understand the conditions in 		
those factories.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be found
on the social responsibility section
of our website.

+ We are creating a structure to
enable our regional sales and 		
stores teams to look at Modern
Slavery risks in their own
operations. This includes
services, consumables, marketing
materials they receive from 		
contractors.
+ Our ongoing series of Modern
Slavery training will be provided
at all our finished product
suppliers and our own regional
offices’ to ensure they have 		
mechanisms to detect potential
risks and take necessary
remedial actions.
+ Finally, we are currently
developing a migrant worker
policy that will cover principles
and requirements to guide our
internal teams and suppliers
towards best practices when 		
employing migrant workers.
