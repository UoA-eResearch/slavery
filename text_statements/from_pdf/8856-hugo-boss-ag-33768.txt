Policies concerning to slavery and human trafficking

HUGO BOSS has implemented a Code of Conduct and a number of internal policies to
ensure that we are conducting business in an ethical and transparent manner. These
include:

1. HUGO BOSS Code of Conduct

The HUGO BOSS Code of Conduct is a binding set of rules, which assist when dealing
with the challenges, both ethical and legal, that arise in the course of day-to-day work. Of
course, our HUGO BOSS Code of Conduct prohibits any kind of forced labor.

2. HUGO BOSS Social Compliance Policy

This policy sets out our working conditions and our compliance with internationally
recognized minimum social and labor standards in relation to our own employees and
those of our suppliers. This includes our rejection of all forms of forced labor, including
slavery and human trafficking.

3. HUGO BOSS Social Standards

The HUGO BOSS Social Standards are part of the practical implementation of the
HUGO BOSS Social Compliance Policy. They are based on the Core Conventions of the
International Labor Organization (ILO) as well as the United Nations Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. Our suppliers are obliged to comply with the HUGO BOSS
Social Standards and have to inform their subcontractors and sub-suppliers about these
standards.

4. Child and Forced Labor Policy

This policy, published in January 2019, clarifies the position of HUGO BOSS on the
subjects of child and forced labor, including slavery and human trafficking. Additionally
this policy shows how HUGO BOSS acts in a case of violation against the HUGO BOSS
Social Standards.

IV. Due Diligence Processes

Prior to the start of a business relationship every direct supplier is required to sign and
acknowledge the HUGO BOSS Social Standards which include provisions on the prohibition
of slavery and human trafficking. Also the HUGO BOSS General Terms and Conditions
obligate suppliers to comply with the HUGO BOSS Social Standards and ensure compliance
through their supply chain.

On a regular basis our direct suppliers are required to undergo compliance audits which
include checks for compliance with the prohibition of slavery and human trafficking.
Announced and unannounced audits are conducted by internal or external partners. In the
year 2018, HUGO BOSS conducted 153 Social Audits for active finished good suppliers
worldwide.

To protect all employees against slavery or human trafficking, HUGO BOSS implemented a
Confidential Helpline to announce potential cases. Employees of our suppliers can use this
Confidential Helpline, too. They will be informed on the HUGO BOSS homepage and during
the audits by an information card.

If suppliers violate our HUGO BOSS Social Standards we issue an action plan, requesting
them to improve compliance immediately with our standards. The supplier's performance will
be reviewed in a follow up audit. If a supplier fails to make progress against the plan, he may
be subject to sanctions up to and including termination of the business relationship.

V. Trainings

All our employees undergo annual Social Standards trainings. One part of our Social
Standard training is to recognize methods and ways of modern slavery and human trafficking
in our supply chain and to report these cases in an effective way.

Also our internal and external audit staff consist of experienced and well trained auditors.
Vi. Approval for this statement
