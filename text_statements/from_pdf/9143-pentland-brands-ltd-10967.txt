0.1 What is modern
slavery?

A UN PRIORIT Y
Goal 8 of the UN Sustainable
Development Goals clearly
calls for the world to take action
on modern slavery:
GOAL 8: Decent Work
and Economic Growth
Target 8.7
Take immediate and effective
measures to eradicate forced
labour, end modern slavery and
human trafficking and secure
the prohibition and elimination
of the worst forms of child
labour, including recruitment
and use of child soldiers, and
by 2025 end child labour in all
its forms.
At Pentland Brands we’ve
prioritised six UN SDGs. Goal
8 is one of them. You can see
all six here.

Modern slavery is a prevalent issue within modern supply chains. It’s
not confined to developing countries or pages of history. It’s happening
now and it’s happening globally.

The term ‘modern’ is used to distinguish this more complex
phenomenon from historical slavery associated with the legal
possession of one person by another.

The Ethical Trade Initiative refers to modern slavery as an overarching
term used to describe:

Estimates on the scale of the issue vary, largely because cases
are difficult to detect. It’s been reported that between 21 million
and 45.8 million men, women and children around the world are
in some form of slavery.*

Human trafficking
A process of bringing a person into a situation of exploitation through
a series of actions, including deceptive recruitment and coercion.

Forced labour
Any work or services which people are not doing voluntarily and
which are exacted under a threat of some form of punishment.

Bonded labour

At Pentland Brands, modern slavery is an unacceptable issue.
We state clearly in Our Standards that work should be freely chosen
and we have a clear position on migrant labour in our vulnerable
workers policy pack.
We recognise that human trafficking and modern slavery can be
difficult to detect. But we are committed to understanding, investigating
and resolving any cases that our due diligence uncovers.

Work demanded as a means of repayment of a debt or a loan.

Slavery
A situation where a person exercises (perceived) power of
ownership over another person.

This report, which has been
approved by the Pentland
Brands Board, looks at the
progress we’ve made in the
past year, and sets our direction
for the years to come.

Being a global sportswear and footwear business means we can
play a pivotal role in protecting people’s rights. Our industry is
heavily reliant on people, and with that comes an inherent responsibility
and great potential to contribute to economic and social development.
We have a strong history in trading ethically. We were a founding
member of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), signatories to the
Indonesia Freedom of Association Protocol, and, most recently,
founding members of the ACT Foundation – a collaboration of
brands, retailers and the global union IndustriALL pushing for living
wages in our supply chains.
We have a well-established system to monitor factory working
conditions in line with Our Standards. But, given that modern slavery
is often a hidden issue, sometimes involving organised crime, we
must continue to evolve our processes to respond effectively to it.
Building from solid foundations, in 2016 we introduced a factory
assessment tool to help us focus our efforts in areas of greatest
risk. We also piloted a new, and thorough investigation process
involving a number of employees across our ethical trade and
supply chain teams at one of our highest risk factories in Thailand.

Unfortunately, during our visit we found strong indications of trafficking
and modern slavery. We are clearly disappointed with what we
discovered. However, it has proved the value of our new assessment
programme, and I’m pleased that we’re now working collaboratively
with the factory to tackle what we’ve found. This matches the approach
we’ve always had, working closely with factories to improve conditions
for the people that work there, and only ending a relationship if a
factory shows a lack of willingness to improve.
Transparency and collaboration will be key to tackling this issue.
In 2014, we were among a group of organisations brought together
by the ETI and the British Retail Consortium to encourage the British
prime minister to introduce Section 54 on transparency in supply
chains to the UK Modern Slavery Act. This year, alongside this report
we are publishing a list of the factories where our products are
assembled. This forms an important part of our commitment to
embrace transparency and work collaboratively with stakeholders.
Issues such as modern slavery are complex and fuelled by
globalisation, so we must work together with others to raise labour
standards and make a collective change.

Our business

We’re a brand management company. We own and
license some of the world’s best-known sport, outdoor
and footwear brands. We design branded products,
market them, and distribute them to retailers.

OUR PORTFOLIO

PENTLAND BRANDS

We have over 1,800 employees across the world.
The majority of people are office based, although
some of our colleagues are based in warehouses
and a limited number of retail outlets.
We do not own factories, but we do co-own three –
two in Sri Lanka and one in Vietnam. We have longlasting relationships with many of our tier 1 suppliers
(those that assemble our products). Almost half of
our annual turnover is generated using factories
we’ve worked with for over 10 years.

PENTLAND MODEL

Stock
This is the supply chain that
creates our consumer products,
i.e. the branded stock we sell
to customers.

Panel print

Non-stock
Our non-stock supply chain
is everything else we purchase
– whether that be services or
consumables, e.g. stationery,
cleaning services, etc.
Direct
This means we have a relationship
with the assembly factory.
Indirect
This means we work with agents
and/or suppliers who may help
with a range of things, e.g. quality
control, product development,
translations or factory sourcing.
We still ultimately own the factory
relationship and we don’t
delegate any of our corporate
responsibility to the agent.

Setting
standards

Our standards and policies
Our Standards guide the way we work and set out what we expect
from our employees and suppliers. They include guidance on how
to do business ethically, with integrity and with respect for people,
and are available in 13 languages. See page 20 for details on how
we audit factories in line with these standards.

Purchasing practices

We are developing more detailed policies to help employees,
suppliers and other stakeholders interpret and implement
Our Standards. These policies will make it easier to address
challenges in a practical way – allowing for more transparent
and collaborative conversations.

We’re members of the ACT Foundation Purchasing Practices
Working Group and are committed to implementing good practice
outcomes in our own operations.

We’ve created a policy pack to help protect the rights of the most
vulnerable: migrant workers, homeworkers and underage workers.
It’s particularly important that suppliers understand our expectations
when it comes to these vulnerable employee groups. The policy
pack has been reviewed and guided by input from the Ethical Trading
Initiative (ETI) and Anti-Slavery International (ASI) and will be
distributed in 2017. We take a positive approach to homeworkers.
You can find out about how we’ve helped to set up stitching centres
for homeworkers in India here.

We developed new manufacturing agreements in 2016 which commit
our suppliers, service providers and manufacturers to tackling all
human trafficking and modern slavery risks in their operations.

In 2016, we began an initial review of our purchasing practices to
check they don’t inadvertently have a negative impact on suppliers’
ability to provide workers with safe and rewarding employment
conditions. This includes payment terms that could negatively impact
the profitability of our manufacturers. For example, currently 85% of
our suppliers are paid within 30 days of receipt of export documents.

Introducing new training on modern slavery
In 2016, we worked with Verité, experts in supply chain, labour and
human rights issues, to develop a training package to help mitigate
modern slavery.
We ran a pilot session in the UK, before training 40 people in our
global supply chain team in September. The first part of the training
targeted buyers, with a one-day session to help them identify and
respond to potential risks. This was followed by a more advanced
two-day session for corporate responsibility practitioners and auditors.

In 2017, we will extend our training to the following levels of

our risks

RISK ASSESSMENT
In April of 2016 we started
work on a modern slavery
risk assessment tool in
partnership with Lancaster
University. The tool is helping
us to build a modern slavery
risk profile across our sourcing
regions and focus our efforts
where the biggest risks are.

The primary source of this
information is the 2016 Global
Slavery Index (GSI) published
by The Walk Free Foundation.
It also uses data from: ILO
Data on Forced Labour (2012);
The US State Department’s
Trafficking in Persons (TIP)
Report (2016); Transparency
International’s Corruption
Perceptions Index (CPI) (2015);
and Freedom in the Work Report
(FITW) by Freedom House (2016).

Assessing country level risk

FAC T O RY L E V E L
RISK PROFILE

We used various data sources to
create a country level risk profile
according to:

Our factory level assessment
is based on a combination of
factory data (including proximity
to borders, worker demographics
and the presence of policies and
management systems) and
country level data.

• the prevalence of modern slavery
in the country;
• the strength of government action
to combat it; and
• the vulnerability of the country to
modern slavery.
This map shows the risk profile of
the countries our factories are based
in. We’ve combined this with factory
data to develop a risk profile for
each factory.

Identifying
issues and

I N D E TA I L
Zero tolerance:
An issue that has an
unacceptable impact on
worker rights or conditions.
It could lead us to suspend
or even end a supplier
relationship if they do not
immediately engage in
sustainable improvement.
Critical:
An issue of serious concern
that could turn into a zero
tolerance issue.
Minor:
Less significant breaches.
Alone, they can be quickly
tackled. But in clusters they
can identify a need for improved
management practices.

Working with factories
We audit all our tier 1 assembly factories on a cyclical
basis to ensure compliance with Our Standards. The
audits are performed by a combination of our internal
audit team and our nominated third party providers.
All external auditors are individually certified social
auditors. If an issue is found as part of this process,
our experienced on-the-ground teams work with
factories to remediate the issue and improve working
conditions in line with Our Standards.
We try to avoid terminating relationships with suppliers,
because that offers no benefit for the workforce.
We would only exit a relationship if a factory
refused to improve. We make sure we exit factory
relationships responsibly, in a way that minimises any
negative impact on the workforce.
During social audits conducted globally in 2016, seven
instances of non-compliance under the base code
‘Employment is freely chosen’ were identified. These
included instances of restriction to workers terminating
their contracts, forced overtime and illegal deductions
from wages. All have been remedied or are in progress.

FAC T O RY R E V I E W P R O C E S S
S TA R T I N G A R E L AT I O N S H I P

We carry out a social
audit of new factories.

They must be approved
before our brands can
place any orders with them.

We conducted 30 initial
audits in 2016.

M O N I T O R I N G S TA N D A R D S

We regularly re-audit
every factory.

In 2016, we made 38 factory
visits as part of this process.

I M P R O V I N G S TA N D A R D S

If we find areas for improvement, we make
recommendations, agree an action plan and
follow up to check on progress. We encourage
manufacturers to include workers in the process
and to consult them on the changes.
In 2016, our in-house teams made 12 factory visits
to check up on improvement progress, understand
the root causes and gauge the impact on workers.

We regularly invite an independent local interviewer
to join our visits and speak directly with factory
employees about working conditions.

Going beyond standard auditing
While our audit protocol can give a good indication of modern slavery
risks, we’re potentially dealing with concealed and sometimes
criminal activities, requiring a somewhat different approach.
In November 2016, we piloted an enhanced factory investigation
process focused specifically on modern slavery risk indicators.
During this investigation we found 15 indicators of modern slavery
and human trafficking. We’ve since put together a working group
that is designing corrective plans. You can read more about this
investigation here. We intend to roll out a similar investigation
process to all our high risk suppliers.

Giving workers a voice
We recognise the need to provide people with a means to report
incidents that they’ve either experienced or seen, especially if they
feel their human rights are not being fully respected.
We’re currently refreshing our internal whistleblowing process and
are looking into how we might extend this to people employed in our
supplier factories.

Piloting our new
investigation
process

Modern slavery is a complex emerging
issue, which means many existing
ethical trade audit processes – including
our own – aren’t sufficient to identify all
potential cases of modern slavery.

W H AT W E D I D

We spent four days in the factory and used a variety of
measures to gather information, including:
Group interviews with middle management to review:

So, in 2016 we piloted a complementary
investigation process to look specifically
for modern slavery and trafficking indicators
in one of our high risk assembly factories.
Amy Benstead, a PhD student from
Lancaster University who is helping
us to develop our approach, writes
a first-hand account of the process.

• Recruitment, selection and hiring
(inc. use of recruitment agencies)
• Documentation and worker files
• Company documentation including:

In November we partnered with Verité and travelled to
Thailand to conduct an in-depth audit focusing specifically
on the risk of migrant labour. Following closely on the tail of
theoretical training in September, this investigation allowed
us to put what we’d learnt into practice.
The factory was identified by our assessment tool as high
risk, as it employs a high proportion of international migrant
workers. Unlike a standard social audit, this investigation
focused on the whole employee experience – from
recruitment to leaving the company – to identify potential
modern slavery risks.

-

Company policies
Employment contracts
Documentation and records
Any retained employee property

Worker interviews focused on:
• Understanding how the migrant workers were recruited, and
how they journeyed from their home country to the factory.
• Understanding their working conditions and social habits.
• Asking migrants about what they expected when their contract
came to an end. Many migrants were on their second contract,
so had factual experiences to report.

What we found
Throughout the process the factory management team
were very cooperative and transparent. The workers
were open and generally satisfied working in the factory.
However, we identified some areas of concern listed
below. Our Head of Sourcing and Head of Ethical
Trade presented the findings to the factory’s senior and
middle management. They also gave an overview of
modern slavery legislation and due diligence.
T YPES OF ISSUES FOUND

W H AT W E ’ R E D O I N G

We have set up a steering group to guide the improvement
programme, consisting of:
• Regional ethical trade manager – Pentland Brands
• Head of Sourcing – Pentland Brands
• Head of Ethical Trading – collaborating brand
• Commercial Director – supplier
• HR head – supplier
• Factory manager – supplier
The factory has agreed to compensate recruitment fees
paid by workers backdated to 1 January 2017, and will pay
such fees in the future.
We have contracted a leading migrant worker expert
and human rights campaigner to provide best practice
guidance on building and implementing our vulnerable
worker policies, operationalising our migrant worker policy
throughout our supply base, and remedying risks.
We’re also in the process of contracting an expert local
partner, previously engaged with remediation and migrant
worker representation.
This independent non-profit organisation will provide
expert help to the factory in implementing our migrant
worker policy.

They will provide ongoing monitoring of policy delivery,
conduct regular interviews with workers to identify any
lasting debt issues, and to measure benefits the policy
delivers. They will provide a whistle-blowing system, so
workers can report any instances of poor practice. They
will also provide training to the workers, to make sure
they’re aware of their rights. The partner will provide
impartial progress reports to the steering group.
This means we are close to finalising the first apparel and
footwear initiative in Thailand aimed at embedding best
practice migrant worker recruitment and employment practices.
Reducing risks across Thailand
As Pentland Brands, we’re working to reduce our risks
across Thailand. We’ve provided our Bangkok office team
with a briefing and presentation on the Modern Slavery
Act, specific issues and challenges relevant to the region
and our migrant worker policy. We’ve delivered training
to all our Thai suppliers, and all suppliers have agreed to
implement our migrant worker policy.

Reflections
We are clearly concerned about the issues we found
during this investigation. However, we see the findings
as a positive step towards tackling modern slavery.
The pilot was, of course, challenging but it has opened
our eyes to some of the risks that are not always
highlighted during the social audit process. We’re now
better informed about the risks in our supply chain,
and we’ll be using this to improve our standard social
audit, further develop our risk assessment matrix, and
develop a specialised modern slavery audit process.

Collaborating with Verité
Verité are independent experts in this area and are
often contracted to conduct specialised audits. This
pilot audit was designed as both a ‘live’ risk assessment
and a capability building exercise for our Ethical Trading
team. Verité provided direction, allowing our team to
be ‘hands-on’ and take the lead. This approach has
helped us to improve our expertise, build our capabilities
and design our modern slavery audit protocol.

“There were two things that really contributed to
making this project successful – one is the openness
of the Pentland team, to learn about the process,
the issues and the standards; and how Pentland
prepared the factory.”
“It is very important to set the tone that this is
collaborative, this is working together.”
Jet Urmeneta, Capability Building Manager, Verité

“The focus & duration of this audit has allowed more
collection of evidence, verification through worker
interviews, more interaction with factory management,
back and forth.”
“I think that has provided layers of understanding,
not only in techniques for discovering issues but also
insight into how and why.”
Tim Pilch, Head of Ethical Trade, Pentland Brands

Acknowledging the gaps in our current approach
LOOKING BEYOND OUR TIER 1 FACTORIES

Our current approach and strategy focuses on our tier 1 suppliers.
We recognise that there is risk in the lower levels of the supply chain.
We’re currently mapping our supply chain down to tier 3, and we’re
in the early stages of understanding our biggest risks and the task
ahead. Our long-standing work on managing hazardous substances
in our supply chain means we already have relationships with many
of our tier 2 suppliers.
We will start to map our non-stock suppliers and services as part of a
wider supply chain strategy.
Our due diligence in our stock supply chain is more advanced than it
is with non-stock or service providers. Over the coming year we plan
to take our learning from our stock supply chain due diligence and
apply it to these areas of our business.
