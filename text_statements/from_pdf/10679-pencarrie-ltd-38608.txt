OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
Our supply chain includes a number of brands who source promotional and corporate clothing and
accessories. These items are for distribution to garment decorators and other onsellers.
We expect our entire supply chain to have a zero-tolerance approach to slavery and human
trafficking. Our suppliers have to demonstrate that they use labour ethically and within the law. Where
they cannot demonstrate this standard, we will look to end the business relationship.
The Managing Director, Tony Lock and Director, Nicci Gratwicke, are ultimately responsible for
compliance in our company departments and for their supplier relationships.
You can find each of our supplier brands’ Ethical Trading Statements on the individual brand pages of
our website.

OUR POLICIES & PROCEDURES
We have the following policies and procedures in place to identify modern slavery risks and prevent
slavery and human trafficking in our operations:

•

Whistleblowing policy: we encourage all of our employees, customers and other business
partners to report any concerns they have about our activities and supply chains. This
includes anything that may increase the risk of slavery or human trafficking. Our
Whistleblowing Policy is designed to make it easy for individuals to make disclosures without
fear of reprisal.

•

Business ethics: We aim to uphold the highest standards of employee conduct and ethical
behaviour. We also require our suppliers to do the same in managing their own employees
and supply chains.

•

Recruitment and use of agency staff: We only use specified, reputable employment
agencies to source labour. We always verify the practices of any new agency we use before
accepting workers from them. We ensure that all potential employees have the legal right to
work in the UK and that we adhere to all relevant employment legislation.

OUR DUE DILIGENCE
We have the following due diligence processes in place to help make sure we are tackling slavery and
human trafficking risks in our business and supply chains:
•

We always make written enquiries when considering new suppliers. We also regularly review
our existing suppliers’ policies on modern slavery and other areas of their operations. We pay
particular attention to the procedures and certifications under which their manufacturers
operate.

•

Each of our brands supplies us with an official Ethical Trading Statement, which can be found
on the individual brand pages on our website.

•

Where possible, we build long-standing relationships with our suppliers, and we always make
clear our expectations of business behaviour.

•

We have systems in place to encourage people to report any concerns and to protect
whistleblowers.

•

We expect each supplier in the supply chain to, at least, adopt ‘one-up’ due diligence on the
next link in the chain. Unfortunately, it’s not practical for us (and every other participant in the
chain) to have a direct relationship with all links in the supply chain.

OUR RISK ASSESSMENT
We have the following risk assessment procedures in place to ensure we are aware of the risks of
modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chains:
•

We regularly review recruitment and payroll systems to ensure our recruitment and
employment practices remain legally compliant.

personal contact with the next link in the supply chain. We assess their understanding of, and
