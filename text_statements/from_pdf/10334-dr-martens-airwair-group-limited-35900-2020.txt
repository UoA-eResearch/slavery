WHAT IS ‘MODERN SLAVERY’?

HIGHLIGHTS OF 2018:

The Ethical Trade Initiative refers to modern slavery as an umbrella term that
includes: forced labour, bonded labour, human trafficking and slavery. The
term “modern” is used to distinguish the complexity of today’s slavery from
historical slavery associated with the legal possession of one person by another.

+ Strengthened our policies by introducing

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
WHERE WE PRODUCE AND SOURCE OUR PRODUCTS
(1ST TIER SUPPLIERS)

COMPONENT SUPPLIERS
(2ND TIER SUPPLIERS)

SERVICE CONTRACTORS

We are a footwear brand, which manufactures and
sources footwear, clothing and accessories. Our
owned and operated footwear factory is located in
Wollaston, UK.

We also work directly with a
large number of our material
and component suppliers,
including leather and textiles,
which are located across
Asia, Europe and
South America.

We also purchase services,
consumables and marketing
materials from various
contractors. These
include labour agents in
our warehouses, logistic
operators and not-for-sale
product suppliers.

We source the majority of our finished footwear, clothing and accessories
from factories in China, Thailand, Vietnam, Lao, Portugal and the UK.
There are more than 25,000 workers in our 1st Tier factories.

Where possible, these suppliers are
nominated by us, which allows us to
have better oversight and controls of the
materials used in our products and the
working conditions.

MODERN SLAVERY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN STATEMENT | OUR SUPPLY CHAIN

We are in the process of mapping and
assessing the risk of the supply chain of
our operations in our headquarters and
regions. While we continue mapping, we
have introduced a modern slavery clause
in our new contract agreements. Where
contracting on supplier’s terms, we will
negotiate compliance with modern
slavery commitments.

OUR COMMITMENTS AND POLICIES
SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT
EXISTING POLICIES:
+ Updated our Supplier Code of Conduct
(to include Subcontractor and
Homeworker Policy)

+ Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy

NEW IN 2018:
Migrant Worker Policy
Doc-trine (business Code of Conduct)

Our suppliers must adhere
to and are audited upon our
Supplier Code of Conduct
(you can find it here), which
has been in place since 2006.
It has been updated annually to reflect
best practices. In 2018, we further updated
our Supplier Code of Conduct to include
our Subcontractor and Homeworker Policy,
which was originally developed as a standalone policy. We also included greater detail
to help suppliers better understand what
constitutes modern slavery/forced labour.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct is based on
the Ethical Trading Initiative’s Base Code,
international norms and industry standards.
This year, in addition to sharing our
policies with all of our first tier suppliers,
we extended this to our key material and
component suppliers, such as tanneries and
outsole suppliers.

MODERN SLAVERY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN STATEMENT | OUR COMMITMENTS AND POLICIES

ANTI-SLAVERY AND HUMAN
TRAFFICKING POLICY
As stated in our previous
report, to ensure that our own
employees are aware of their
obligations under the Modern
Slavery Act, we introduced
an Anti-Slavery and Human
Trafficking Policy in 2016.
We conduct modern slavery awareness
training on a regular basis for our relevant
employees, including those at our sourcing
offices in Asia. Alongside this, we wanted
our employees to have the opportunity and
ability to speak up. In 2018, we introduced a
confidential hotline as an additional means
for employees to raise concerns relating
to human rights, modern slavery, or any
other area covered in our business Code of
Conduct (DOC-trine).

PG7

MIGRANT WORKER POLICY

THE DOC-trine

Migrant workers in supply
chains are more vulnerable
to modern slavery because
they are unlikely to raise
grievances with their
employers or the authorities –
especially if they
are undocumented.

In addition to updating our Supplier Code of Conduct, we have also introduced a
global code of business conduct called The DOC-trine which raises awareness and
expectations amongst our employees regarding human rights and modern slavery.

This is a shared concern within the industry
and requires a collective and collaborative
approach to tackle this issue. This year we
introduced a Migrant Worker Policy and
implementation guidelines (which you can
find here). These are based on the Dhaka
Principles, which were developed by the
Institute of Human Rights in Business
(IHBR) and are based on international
best practices, which address the issues
migrant workers may face. We introduced
these specific policy requirements across
all our key suppliers, focussing first on the
suppliers who are based in countries where
there is a higher risk of migrant workers.

SPEAK UP
We have introduced a confidential hotline as an additional means for Dr. Martens employees to raise concerns relating to
human rights, modern slavery, or any other area covered in our business Code of Conduct.

OUR FOCUS AREAS

Non-footwear suppliers, which represent around 3%
of our total production value, include manufacturers
producing our leather and textile accessories, bags
and garments.

1.SUPPLY CHAIN
RISK ASSESSMENT

As a result of our efforts, we have seen:

+1st Tier: Compliance audits extended to
non-footwear suppliers.

Suppliers in China strengthen their own control
mechanisms around recruitment of agency workers
in order to verify employment conditions, as well
as to ensure required wages are paid.

+ 2nd Tier: Fully mapped component
and material suppliers and extended
compliance audits to key component and
material suppliers such as tanneries and
outsole manufacturers.

Suppliers in Thailand are now either employing
local staff or directly recruiting migrant workers
instead of using recruitment agencies, which has
resulted in greater protection of worker rights.

2.CAPACITY BUILDING:
Modern slavery training to Chinese
footwear and key component suppliers as
well as our sourcing team who are based
in China.

3.INTERNAL ENGAGEMENT
AND AWARENESS BUILDING.

SUPPLY CHAIN RISK ASSESSMENT
In addition to the compliance audit risk
assessments at our 1st Tier suppliers
explained in the previous report,
we have now extended these audits
to cover our non-footwear suppliers.

MODERN SLAVERY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN STATEMENT | OUR FOCUS AREAS

Increased transparency from suppliers regarding
workers’ wages, supporting the elimination of
unauthorised monetary deductions.
In 2017 we carried out a 2nd Tier material and
component supplier mapping survey, covering all our
finished good suppliers. Following this work, this year
we mapped all of our 2nd Tier suppliers, including
those that are nominated by our suppliers. This has led
us to consolidate and assess the compliance of these
suppliers against our standards.

In 2018, we collaborated with Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) to provide modern slavery
training to our key footwear and material suppliers in China. The training provided an
opportunity for our key suppliers to engage in the topic and get an overview of what
modern slavery is, the global legislative work around it, and how it links to our Supplier
Code of Conduct. During the training, suppliers looked at real examples of modern
slavery in China, learning how to identify these risks in their daily operations and what
an acceptable remediation process looks like.
After attending this training, our suppliers committed to further enhance their controls
over their own supply chains as well as providing modern slavery training to their
employees. We plan to follow up on these commitments and will continue to provide
support to our suppliers on this topic.
In 2019, we will extend the modern slavery training to our key suppliers and employees
from our other sourcing countries.

MODERN SLAVERY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN STATEMENT | OUR FOCUS AREAS

INTERNAL ENGAGEMENT AND AWARENESS BUILDING
We continue to raise awareness and
understanding of modern slavery
within other business areas, especially
those directly involved in our sourcing
operations and recruitment. As part
of this engagement, we extended our
partnership with Ethical Trade Initiative,
to provide training to our team based
in China who manage relationships
with our suppliers. This was a separate
training session from the one held for

suppliers, as it was intended to give a
broader understanding on modern slavery
to our team, as well as to underline the
due diligence mechanisms to identify
potential risks in our supply chain. Most
importantly, the training focused on
the impact sourcing practices have on
a supplier’s ability to operate ethically.
In the year ahead, we will look for
opportunities to extend this training to
other areas of our business.

COLLABORATION:
We are proud that in 2018 we became
a signatory of the British Retail
Consortiums industry initiative,
Better Retail Better World.

We also joined, along with other major
UK retailers’, a CEO forum on modern
slavery, organised by ASOS, one of our
key customers.

This is a voluntary scheme, which aims to mobilise the
retail industry to tackle some of the biggest global
challenges of the coming decades, highlighted by the UN
Sustainable Development Goals. These include respecting
human rights, supporting sustainable markets and
developing skills, which are fundamental to businesses.

The aim was to identify and address the risks of forced
labour and human trafficking in collective supply chains
Discussion points included the modern slavery challenges,
risks companies face and ideas for addressing them.
All participants agreed to greater transparency, improved
reporting, increased collaboration and training for
different stakeholders.

committed TO ERADICATING FORCED LABOUR
HERE AT DR. MARTENS, WE ARE COMMITTED
AND MODERN SLAVERY BY WORKING WITH OTHERS AND PROMOTING GOOD
PRACTICES IN OUR OWN OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN.

PROGRESS AT A GLANCE
As a business, we are committed to the continuous improvement in our approach to tackle modern slavery, forced labour and human trafficking.
We have achieved good progress against the commitments we set last year. Here is a summary of what we have accomplished so far:

2017/18
COMMITMENT
Extend our CSR assessments
in all non-footwear factories
to get a better understanding
of the labour standards and
working conditions.

We are creating a structure to
enable our regional sales and stores
teams to recognise modern slavery
risks in their own operations. This
includes services, consumables,
and the marketing materials they
receive from contractors.

Modern slavery training
will be provided at all
our finished product
suppliers and our own
regional offices.

Developing a Migrant Worker
Policy that will cover principles
and requirements to guide our
internal teams and suppliers
towards best practices when
employing migrant workers.

We are increasing our
resources in Asia to start
assessing our second tier
suppliers to understand the
conditions in those factories.

2018/19
PROGRESS
CSR audits extended in
non-footwear suppliers in Asia,
as well as European suppliers
including UK.

Updated our requirements for
Gift with Purchase suppliers
to incorporate ethical trading
standards, including their own
statement on modern slavery.

Partnered with ETI to
conduct modern slavery
training to key suppliers
in China.

Working with internal teams to map
our service, marketing materials and
consumables contractors, starting
with those in the UK, followed by
those in Asia and the Americas.
Migrant Worker Policy and implementation
guidelines are developed and shared with
all finished good suppliers and key
raw material suppliers.

MODERN SLAVERY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN STATEMENT | PROGRESS AT A GLANCE

We have recruited an Asia CSR
officer who is responsible for
assessing 2nd Tier suppliers
and supporting our 1st
Tier suppliers.

PG12

WHAT IS NEXT?
NEXT YEAR, WE WILL:
+ Continue the previous years objectives.
Further map the risks deeper in our supply
chain and operations.

+ Provide more training to our own
employees and our suppliers in sourcing
countries beyond China.

+ Tackle the root causes of modern slavery
by implementing responsible recruitment
best practices and using more in-depth/
stringent assessment techniques during
the audits.

+ Identify and partner with key external
stakeholders and seek further
collaboration with other industry
members and NGOs.
