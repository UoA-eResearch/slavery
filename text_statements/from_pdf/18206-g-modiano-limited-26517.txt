(UK)

G. Modiano Limited has asked all of its suppliers to sign declarations confirming that
neither they nor their supply chains engage in slavery and human trafficking as defined by
the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

Our principal raw material is greasy wool, most of which is sourced from Australia, New
Zealand, South Africa, South America and Europe. We have already received signed
declarations from all our principal sources.

Our mill in the Czech Republic has also confirmed that they are in full compliance with the
Act.

We are not aware of any incidence of slavery or human trafficking in the wool growing
industry in those countries where we source wool. Indeed most of our wool comes from
countries with a long established respect for the law and where slavery and human
trafficking is illegal. We are committed to ensuring that acts of slavery and human
trafficking do not exist anywhere within our supply chain.
