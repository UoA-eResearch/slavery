Introduction

A view from
our CEO
No one should be forced to work against
their will, but millions of people worldwide
are victims of modern slavery. At Pentland
Brands Ltd, we are not afraid to take a
stand for something we believe in. And
we believe everyone has the right to
fair pay, safe working conditions, and
to be treated with dignity and respect.

our approach with three new policies
on child labour and young workers,
migrant workers and homeworking
to protect the most vulnerable in
our supply chain. And we’re training
hundreds of people across the business,
so they can spot the first signs of
modern slavery, however subtle.

We support global efforts to tackle
modern slavery and we’re working hard
to negate any related risks in our supply
chain. This is our second annual update
on our position and our progress.

We reinforced our commitment to
transparency by updating our published
list of tier one factories and piloting a
process to map homeworkers used
by one of our suppliers in India. We
haven’t got as far as we had hoped
in mapping tier 2 suppliers, but we’ll
continue to work on this in 2018.

As a global footwear, sports and fashion
company, we depend on the people
who work for us and in our supply chain
– and we’re committed to respecting
their rights. This isn’t new for Pentland
Brands. We have a strong history in
trading ethically and we are a founding
member of the Ethical Trading Initiative.
In 2017, we continued to monitor
factory working conditions in line with
Our Standards. We’ve strengthened

In 2017, I was able to visit the Thai
factory where we had discovered
indicators of trafficking and modern
slavery, and understand the progress
made since our initial investigation in
2016. As part of this remediation, I was
encouraged to see that we’ve worked
with our suppliers across the country

to start implementing our migrant
worker policy and we’re monitoring
worker conditions closely through
our new partnership with the Issara
Institute, including collecting feedback
directly from the workers themselves.
Partnering with local experts, NGOs,
and other brands and buyers remains
an important part of our approach in
addressing the complex, and often
hidden, issue of modern slavery.
In 2018, we’ll focus on making sure
all suppliers are aware of our new
policies on vulnerable workers, as
well as mapping, identifying and
addressing risks deeper in our
supply chain. I look forward to
reporting our progress next year.

Who we are and how we work

Our Business
We’re a global brand
management company. We
manage and license some
of the world’s best-known
sport, outdoor and footwear
brands. We design branded
products, market them and
distribute them to retailers.
We have over 1,700
employees across the world.
The majority of employees are
office based, although some
of our employees are based
in warehouses and a limited
number of retail outlets.
We outsource most of our
manufacturing, but we do
co-own four factories: three in
Sri Lanka and one in Vietnam.

Non Stock Suppliers

Definitions
Stock

Direct

This is the supply chain
that creates our consumer
products, the branded
stock we sell to customers.
Our tier 1 suppliers cut,
sew, embellish, and
assemble our finished
products. A supplier
may own and manage
multiple factories.

This means we order
products directly from
the assembly factory or
from the supplier that
owns the factory.

Non-stock
Our non-stock supply
chain is everything else
we purchase to support
our business, whether
that be services, such as
cleaning, or consumables,
such as stationery.

Distribution and retail

Indirect
This means we work
through agents and/or
suppliers that don’t own
the factories, who may
help with a range of things,
such as quality control,
product development,
translations or factory
sourcing. We still ultimately
own the factory relationship
and we don’t delegate
any of our corporate
responsibility to the agent.

Tackling
modern
slavery

Tackling Modern Slavery

What is
Modern Slavery?
Modern slavery is a prevalent
issue within modern supply
chains. It’s not confined to
developing countries or pages
of history. It’s happening now
and it’s happening globally.
The Ethical Trading Initiative
(ETI) uses the term ‘modern
slavery’ to describe:

Human trafficking

A process of bringing a
person into a situation of
exploitation through a series
of actions, including deceptive
recruitment and coercion.

Forced labour

Any work or services
which people are not doing
voluntarily and which are
exacted under a threat of
some form of punishment.

Bonded labour

Work demanded as a
means of repayment
of a debt or a loan.

Slavery

A situation where a person
exercises (perceived)
power of ownership
over another person.

It can also include victims of
forced marriage, domestic
servitude and sexual
exploitation. The term ‘modern’
is used to distinguish this more
complex phenomenon from
historical slavery associated
with the legal possession of
one person by another.
Estimates on the scale
of the issue vary widely
because cases are difficult
to detect. It’s been reported
that between 25 million and
40 million men, women and
children around the world are
in some form of slavery.

12

No industry is immune to
modern slavery. Supply
chains in the apparel and
footwear industry are
complex, making it hard
to control every stage in
production. There are over
113,500 people working at
our tier 1 suppliers alone.

Tackling Modern Slavery

Challenges for
our sector

Risks inherent in our industry
include those related to
Migrant workers
Migrant workers are common in
global supply chains, particularly
in sectors relying on low skilled
labour. Unfortunately, migrant
workers tend to be vulnerable to
exploitation, human trafficking
and very low wages. They
can be forced to work, paid
little or nothing, have identity
documents withheld and made
to pay for their own recruitment.
Working with agents
Sometimes agents are used
to find suppliers or consolidate
relationships with a manufacturer.
Using an agent can make it
harder to maintain transparency
of factory manufacturing sites.

Casual and homeworkers
Hand stitching of products such
as footwear often happens
in low income, rural areas, in
people’s homes. This can make
human rights issues difficult to
manage, because the supply
chain is informal and dispersed.
There is a lack of visibility of
homeworking supply chains,
and legislation protecting the
human rights and employment
status of homeworkers and
casual workers is often weaker.
The licensed business model
This model is common
with global brands and
can mean that there is no
commercial relationship
with partner factories,
making it difficult to enforce
standards at factory level.

Demand cycles
We’re not in the business of
fast fashion, but we do work to
four annual peaks in demand.
Excessive demands from
companies can increase the risk
of modern slavery if suppliers
enforce excessive working
hours, draft in temporary
labour or subcontract the work
to meet a client’s deadline.
These are shared challenges,
requiring collective action
to make progress. Find out
what we’re doing to tackle
these issues on page 17.

13

Tackling Modern Slavery

Our approach
For Pentland Brands, modern
slavery is an unacceptable
issue. We state clearly in ‘Our
Standards’ that work should be
freely chosen and we set out
our position on most vulnerable
workers in our new policies on
child labour and young workers,
migrant workers and homeworking.
We know that human trafficking
and modern slavery can be
difficult to detect. But we are
committed to conducting due
diligence on this issue and
understanding, investigating
and resolving any cases that our
risk assessments and ongoing
monitoring might uncover.

A UN Priority
At Pentland Brands we’ve prioritised six of
the UN Sustainable Development Goals,
including Goal 3, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 13.

Goal 8: Decent Work
and Economic Growth
Target 8.7 Take immediate and effective
measures to eradicate forced labour, end
modern slavery and human trafficking and
secure the prohibition and elimination of
the worst forms of child labour, including
recruitment and use of child soldiers, and
by 2025 end child labour in all its forms.

“As one of the founding members of
ETI, Pentland continues to lead the
way in its approach to modern slavery.
Its last modern slavery statement was
clear, honest and open about the nature
of the company and the risks in its
supply chain, and clearly demonstrated
the steps it is taking to tackle one of
the great human rights issues of our
time. This is what good practice looks
like, and I hope to see many more
brands following Pentland’s lead.”
Cindy Berman, Head of Modern Slavery
Strategy, Ethical Trading Initiative
(commenting on our first Modern Slavery
Report published in 2017)

Our focus on modern slavery also supports
Goal 10, which aims to reduce inequality.

Review for more on the Sustainable
Development Goals we’re contributing to.

What
we’re
doing

Modern Slavery Report 2018

What we’re doing

Setting
Standards
Our standards and policies
‘Our Standards’ guide the way
we work and set out what we
expect from our employees and
suppliers. It includes guidance
on how to do business ethically,
with integrity and with respect
for people, and is available in
13 languages. See page 20 for
details on how we audit factories
in line with these standards.
In 2017, we published policies to
protect three types of vulnerable
workers in our supply chain:

+

Child labour and
young worker policy

We set out our commitment
and responsibilities to
ensure children and young
people are never exploited
in our supply chain. A child
worker is someone under
the age of 15, or below the
legal minimum employment
age. A young worker is
legally entitled to work but
is 15 years old or above the
minimum age of employment
and below the age of 18. Our
policy requires suppliers
and partners to keep careful
records of workers’ ages and
copies of official identification
documents, protect the
welfare of any suspected or

confirmed child workers, report
their presence in the supply
chain to us, and work with us
and local NGOs to remedy the
situation responsibly, in the
best long-term interest of the
child and his or her relatives.

+

Migrant worker policy

This details our commitment
and responsibilities to protect
migrant workers, and our
expectation that migrant
workers are treated equally
and without discrimination. It
covers detailed requirements
in 13 areas such as recruitment
fees, paying workers,
providing a safe workplace
and freedom to leave.

+

Homeworking policy

We take a positive approach
to homeworkers and set
out our commitment and
responsibilities clearly. We
require suppliers and partners
to help us identify homeworking
in their supply chains and
work with us to ensure good
working conditions. Find out
more about our approach to
homeworking on page 29.
Feedback from the ETI and
Anti-Slavery International,
among several experts
and regional expert NGOs,
informed the policies, which
give our suppliers and
partners detailed guidance on
implementing Our Standards.

What we’re doing

Setting
Standards
Ethical sourcing guidelines
for licensees
Sometimes when you see the
logo of one of our brands, the
garment was made by a licensee.
Licensees must follow the same
high ethical standards and tell us
which factories they source from.
We work to improve our
licensees’ understanding of
modern slavery risks and to
share what we’ve learned
about how to protect workers
in their supply chain.

Purchasing practices

In 2017, we updated
our Licensee Sourcing
Manual to explain:

+ What modern slavery
is and why it matters
+

Licensees’ responsibilities to
address modern slavery risks

+ How to select factories
that meet ‘Our Standards’,
in turn minimising the risk
of modern slavery
+ The major modern slavery
indicators in our industry

We want to support suppliers in
tacking modern slavery risks by
making sure we don’t inadvertently
encourage practices such as
unauthorised subcontracting,
late wage payments or overly
long working hours.
We strive to take a responsible
approach to purchasing, including
planning, sourcing and buying. We
pay suppliers quickly to support
their cash flow and profitability.
In 2017, 82% of our suppliers
were paid within 30 days of
receipt of export documents.
We’re also changing the way
we forecast and order products.
Together with our biggest
customers, we’re planning more
accurately over the long term, so
manufacturers can manage peaks in
their workload and avoid too much

overtime. We’re bringing together
a new cross-functional team to
track our progress against our own
forecasts and see if it’s working.
Pentland Brands is a founding
member of the ACT Foundation,
a partnership of brands and the
global union IndustriALL that is
committed to improving wages in
the apparel and footwear industry.
In 2017, we benchmarked our
purchasing practices against our
ACT peers to identify best practice
and areas for improvement.
We contributed to developing
ACT’s purchasing practices
assessment process through our
participation in the Foundation’s
Purchasing Practices Working
Group. In 2018, we’ll continue
to consult with our suppliers and
support the ACT Foundation to
develop industry best practices
for responsible purchasing.

17

We’re training hundreds of
employees across our business to
spot indicators of modern slavery,
wherever they work. Our Executive
Team have completed the training
and we’ve started intensive
workshops for people in factoryfacing and warehouse roles.
By the end of 2017, we had trained
over 90 employees and over 300
more will complete the training in
2018, including all factory-facing and
warehouse employees. Everyone
in these roles gets a toolkit to help
them identify potential indicators
of modern slavery during factory
visits or in our warehouses.
We’re using an online training
course to reach the rest of
our employees worldwide.

The ‘ABC’ of modern slavery
Modern stlavery can be hard to
spot. The signs can be subtle, such
as someone seeming anxious
or withdrawn, wearing clothes
unsuitable for their job, or having
few personal possessions.
Our modern slavery toolkit is
designed to help our staff recognise
and report potential slavery
indicators. The ‘ABC’ toolkit reminds
them to look out for risks in three
areas: appearance, behaviour and
conditions. During our training
for factory-facing and warehouse
teams, employees use the toolkit in
case study scenarios, helping them
to spot indicators in real situations
and understand how to report their
observations back to the CR team.

Understanding

Assessing country and
factory level risks

+

Modern slavery can happen
anywhere in the world. But the risk
is greater in some countries than
others. Understanding where the
risks lie in our supply chain is an
important step in our journey to
stamp out modern slavery. That’s
exactly what our tier 1 supplier
risk assessment tool is for.

+

Developed with Lancaster University,
the tool helps us to build a modern
slavery risk profile for regions we
source from. Together with various
data sources3, it feeds into country
level risk profiles, which evaluate:

The prevalence of forced
labour in the country

Factory level risks profile

The strength of government
action to combat it

+

The vulnerability of the
country to modern slavery

We also use our social audits and
a detailed supplier questionnaire
to understand risk at factory
level. We combine the country
risk profile with data on areas
such as the factory’s proximity to
borders, worker demographics,
and the presence of policies
and management systems.
So far, we’ve assessed all our tier
1 suppliers and we’re exploring
how we can effectively assess
risk among our tier 2 suppliers.

What we’re doing

Identifying issues
and taking action
Working with factories
We conduct social audits
for all of our tier 1 assembly
factories on a regular basis to
ensure compliance with ‘Our
Standards’. The audits are
performed by a combination
of external consultants, our
Corporate Responsibility team
and other organisations, such
as Better Work. All external
auditors are independently
certified social auditors.

If an issue is identified, our
experienced Corporate
Responsibility team works with
factories to analyse the root
cause. We work with factories
to remedy the issue and
make lasting improvements
to working conditions in
line with ‘Our Standards.’
We try to avoid terminating
relationships with factories
because that offers no benefit
for the workforce. But we
will exit a relationship if a
factory refuses to improve. In
these cases, we make sure
we exit factory relationships
responsibly, in a way that
minimises any negative
impact on the workforce.

in the process and to consult them on the changes
In 2017, we made 19 targeted audits to check up
on improvement progress, understand the root
causes and gauge the impact on workers

We regularly contract

Supplier audits in 2017
During social audits we
conducted in 2017, most
instances of non-compliance
were minor, while 20% of
instances were critical.
The most common critical
issues were in relation to
inconsistences found in
workers’ wage records,
inadequate holidays
provided to workers,
lack of social insurance
provision, general health
and safety issues, and
excessive working hours.

We identified one zero
tolerance issue in relation
to minimum wages not
being paid at a factory
in China. This issue was
satisfactorily resolved
within two months of
being identified.

What we’re doing

Identifying issues
and taking action
Our modern slavery
investigation process
Modern slavery can be hard
to spot, unless you know what
to look for, and can include
concealed and criminal
activities. This complexity
means social audit processes
– including our own – aren’t
always sufficient to identify all
cases of modern slavery.
Our in-depth modern slavery
investigation process is designed
to investigate the whole employee
experience – from recruitment
to leaving the company – to
identify potential modern
slavery risks. We developed
it in partnership with Verité,
experts in supply chain, labour
and human rights issues.

We used this process to assess a
factory in Thailand in November
2016 and found 15 indicators
of modern slavery, particularly
related to migrant worker
recruitment and employment.
We worked closely with the
factory’s management to agree
an improvement plan to address
these issues. More detail about
the process and results of
this audit can be found in our
2017 Modern Slavery Report.
In 2017, we trained our teams in
Thailand to equip them to spot
and remedy potential modern
slavery risks. We developed new
policies on vulnerable workers
(see page 15) and established
a partnership with a specialist
local NGO, with a view to
embedding best practices across
the seven factories we source
from in Thailand (see page 25).

Giving workers a voice
We want everyone in our supply
chain to be treated with dignity
and respect and feel they can
speak up. We’re enabling
workers to find their voice by:

+

Educating factory
workers about their rights

+

Using Issara Institute’s
Inclusive Labour Monitoring
system at all the factories in
Thailand and Myanmar which
allows employees to raise
concerns through a multilingual
hotline and smartphone app

+

Informing homeworkers
of their rights to bargain
collectively to negotiate
better working conditions
with employers and agents

+

Gathering data on union
representation among workers
at our tier 1 suppliers to help
us identify where workers
may not have the freedom
or support to speak out

+

Exploring how we can
extend whistle blowing to
more people employed in the
factories we source from

Putting policy into practice

Embedding our modern
slavery approach in Thailand
We’re working to embed a best
practice approach to migrant
worker rights and recruitment
in the factories we source
from in Thailand. Our supplier
risk assessment highlighted
this as a priority issue.
In our first modern slavery
report we provided details of
our investigation into the risks
for foreign migrant workers in
Thailand and our discovery of
indicators of potential trafficking
and modern slavery. It’s
common for migrant workers
to be recruited for low skilled
work in Thailand, often from
neighbouring countries such
as Cambodia and Myanmar.

In response to these
findings, in 2017 we:

+

Drafted and published
our vulnerable worker
policies, making our
expectations clear to
suppliers and business
partners, and providing
guidance on operational
management of migrant
workers, child labour
and young workers,
and homeworking.

+

Signed a partnership
agreement with
Bangkok-based NGO,
the Issara Institute, to
deliver their Inclusive
Labour Monitoring
System at all our Thai
manufacturing sites.

+

Held a seminar in
Bangkok introducing
our new policies and
the Issara Institute
partnership to all our
Thai manufacturers –
all our Thai suppliers
agreed to implement the
new policies and work
with the Issara Institute.

Putting policy into practice

Embedding our modern
slavery approach in Thailand
Tracking progress and
giving workers a voice
Issara Institute are delivering
their Inclusive Labour
Monitoring system at all our
Thai manufacturing sites,
gaining ongoing feedback on
labour conditions at factories
directly from the people
working there. Workers
can report issues or ask for
help at any time through a
multilingual telephone hotline.

Issara’s ‘Golden Dreams’
smartphone app also
targets current and
prospect Burmese language
migrants. it’s a platform for
learning and exchanging
information, reviews, ratings,
comments, and advice
about employers, recruiters
and service providers in
both home and destination
countries. the concept is
similar to Tripadvisor but
the topics are those most
relevant to migrant workers.

Issara Institute combines
this feedback with regular
workplace risk assessments
and interviews with local
experts and workers to build
a better picture of what’s
happening day-to-day at
factories. This information
is shared directly with the
factory, and Issara work with
the factory to advise how to
remedy issues. They report
back to us if progress stalls.

“When Pentland Brands’ and Issara
leadership teams went to Yangon to
visit recruitment agencies sending
workers to their suppliers, the agencies
– which send tens of thousands of
workers to Thailand and Malaysia
annually – remarked that this was the
first time they had ever been visited
by a global buyer. Pentland Brands
is deeply committed to unpacking the
issues and driving positive change
for migrant workers on the ground.”
Mark Taylor
Director of Strategy & Global
Partnerships at Issara Institute

Putting policy into practice

Building suppliers’
capability in china
“After training, we paid more attention to
social insurance problems – currently,
the percentage of workers enrolled is
a bit low and we understand that there
is a risk for the factory. Now we will
focus on addressing the root cause:
providing more training to raise workers’
awareness, helping them understand
social insurance and how to use it, and
educating them on the importance of
protecting themselves with insurance.”
Mr Zhu Wan Mao
Supplier factory manager

We don’t audit a factory and
then disappear. And we don’t
drop suppliers at the first
sign of a problem. Instead,
we partner with suppliers to
improve standards over time.
Ultimately, we believe this
is the most effective way to
make things better for workers.
In 2017, we worked closely
with factories in China
that had not met all of
‘Our Standards’ to help
them improve. We trained
factory managers, union
representatives and staff
responsible for production,
employee welfare, and
health and safety.

Modern slavery was one of
the issues covered in the
training, along with paying
fair wages, employee
benefits, health and
safety, working hours, and
environmental protection.
We also shared tools, for
example to help track working
hours more accurately.
Following our training
and capability building
programme, more than a
quarter of critical issues have
already been sustainably
resolved at participating
factories, and we’re
continuing to check progress
with regular monitoring.

The stitching of certain parts
of our footwear is a skill that is
best done by hand. There are
many homeworkers involved
in hand-stitching, and we aim
to support them as a vital
part of our supply chain.
Homeworkers are often women
relying on paid work that’s
flexible and fits in with their
family and domestic duties. But
we recognise there are risks
to homeworking. It’s typically
informal, low-paid and insecure
work, organised through a
network of agents. This gives
homeworkers little visibility in
supply chains or control over
their employment conditions.
The easiest way to eliminate
these risks in our supply
chain would be for us to
ban homeworking. But this
approach wouldn’t improve

things for homeworkers. In
2017, we continued to partner
with Homeworkers Worldwide
and Cividep on our pilot
programme, which focused
on mapping homeworkers for
one supplier in our leather
shoe supply chain, whilst also
understanding the context
and challenges of homework.
During 2017, our NGO
partners mapped the network
of agents and homeworkers
within the supply chain of
one of our suppliers, traced
value chains, and conducted
interviews a sample of 30
workers to understand their
situation and find solutions
to improve their employment
conditions. We also took
part in a regional conference
in Tamil Nadu, which was
attended by homeworkers,
suppliers and brands, to share

our learnings from the pilot
programme and encourage
positive change across the
sector. We also introduced a
detailed policy for homeworking
this year, to give all our
suppliers clearer guidance
to protect homeworkers.
In the second phase of the pilot
programme, we will continue
to work with our NGO partners
to understand how we can
establish fairer piece rates
and embed improved payment
systems, further to researching
how our purchasing practices
impact our homeworkers. The
findings of the pilot will allow us
to design a better employment
system to protect homeworkers
as a whole, improving their
pay and working hours, and
formalising their employment
rights and conditions.

“Homeworkers Worldwide has been
working in partnership with Pentland
Brands since mid 2016 on a project
to improve working conditions for the
homeworkers within its footwear supply
chain. Pentland has been willing to put
the time and resource in to develop
an effective partnership, both with
ourselves and our Indian NGO partner,
and crucially, with their local supplier.

Putting policy into practice

Supporting vulnerable
homeworkers in India

We appreciate Pentland’s willingness to
recognise the presence of homeworkers
in their supply chains, and their
commitment to working in partnership
to bring about real improvements in
homeworkers’ pay and conditions. We
are working closely with Pentland on
solutions which are sustainable, and
which we both hope could become a
model for the sector.”

What we’re
focusing on next
There’s always more that we
can do and we’ll continue
to work with partners to
tackle modern slavery.
In 2018, we’ll continue to
communicate our vulnerable
worker policies to suppliers
and translate our migrant
worker policy into Thai,
Burmese and Khmer.
Alongside the Issara Institute,
we will start work to implement
our migrant worker policy
and process at a second
factory in Thailand that
employs foreign migrants.

Better whistleblowing and
grievance procedures at
suppliers will be another
focus, as we aim to
strengthen systems for
workers to raise concerns,
especially with those that
lack union representation.
We’ll also continue to
identify, map and monitor
risks deeper into our
supply chain, beyond
tier 1 suppliers.
