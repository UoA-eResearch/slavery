CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT DISCLOSURE
Targus is committed to ensuring that our supply chain reflects Targus’s values
and respect for human rights and the environment.
Targus’s relationships with suppliers are based on lawful, socially responsible
and fair practices. We expect our suppliers to obey the laws and regulations that
require them to treat workers fairly, provide a safe and healthy work environment
and protect environmental quality.
Targus obligates its suppliers by contract to certify compliance with our
“Corporate Social Compliance Standards,” which are contained in our Vendor
Management Guidelines. These standards require that suppliers not utilize
forced, prison, or indentured labor, or subject workers to any form of compulsion
or coercion. Targus’s suppliers are obligated to impose the same standards on
their suppliers.
Targus has a program to verify supplier compliance with our standards, which
includes on-site audits of supplier factories conducted by Targus personnel
trained in auditing techniques to recognize and report non-compliance with our
expectations.
To maintain internal accountability, Targus sourcing personnel follow an “eyes
always open” approach under which all relevant personnel are trained to
recognize environmental, health, safety, and labor concerns, including issues
relating to human trafficking and forced labor, and to report and investigate all
suspicions of improper conduct at all suppliers globally.
Suppliers that fail to meet Targus’s expectations are required at a minimum to
take immediate corrective actions. Failure to implement such actions will lead to
the termination of the supplier relationship. Employees who violate Targus’s
policies are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of
employment.
This disclosure applies to all consolidated Targus affiliates that are California
taxpayers subject to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act.
