DISCLOSURE UNDER CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN
SUPPLY CHAINS ACT OF 2010
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (“SB 657”) requires retailers and manufacturers
doing business in California to disclose what, if any, efforts they have taken to eliminate slavery and human
trafficking from their supply chains.
Commitment
Etro S.p.A. (“Etro”) supports the goals of SB 657 to eradicate slavery and human trafficking.
Etro is committed to ensuring that its relationships with suppliers are based on lawful practices. Etro expects
its suppliers to comply with all applicable laws. To that end, all Etro suppliers warrant that they will not
violate any applicable laws or regulations in their performance of services for Etro, and such laws would
include those relating to human trafficking and slavery.
Verification
To verify each supplier’s compliance, Etro directly (not indirectly through a third party) conducts random onsite inspections of its suppliers’ relevant facilities.
Action
If it is discovered that a supplier has violated this warranty, including where the supplier has incorporated any
material into Etro products not in compliance with any applicable laws, the violation will be considered a
breach of Etro’s agreement by the supplier, which would entitle Etro to promptly exclude the supplier from its
supply chain.
