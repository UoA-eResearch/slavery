Fred Perry Limited (?Fred Perry?)
Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement

At Fred Perry, we believe all workers must be treated with dignity, respect and fairness and will not
knowingly tolerate forced or compulsory labour or human trafficking in any parts of our business.

Our business operates retail shops and wholesales its products throughout the United Kingdom and
other selected international markets. Our strategy is to maintain long-term relationships with key
partners, and so our products are sourced from a small range of national and international suppliers.
This has enabled us to build stronger relationships, and to better resolve issues with our suppliers.

Our Code of Conduct on Ethical Trading sets out our expectations for suppliers across a number of key
areas:

?mployment is freely chosen

Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining are respected

Working conditions are safe and hygienic

Child labour shall not be used

Living wages are paid

Working hours are not excessive

No discrimination is practised

Regular employment is provided

No harsh or inhumane treatment is allowed

We expect all our suppliers to sign up to the Code. We then undertake all reasonable and practical
steps to ensure that the standards outlined in our Code, are implemented throughout the businesses
of our suppliers. We assess any instances of non-compliance on a case-by-case basis and tailor
remedial action, as appropriate. Our approach is collaborative and we seek to offer our suppliers the
additional support and resource they need to make any required improvements.

We only continue to trade with those who comply with our Code or those who are taking verifiable
ste wards compliance.
