Introduction

A view from our
CEO, Andy Long
We strive to do the right
thing, not the easy thing,
every day. When it comes
to tackling modern slavery
and improving labour rights,
this commitment can have
a life-changing impact on the
people making our products.
We believe everyone has the right to fair
pay, safe working conditions, and to be
treated with dignity and respect. Yet there
are millions of victims of modern slavery
worldwide. We’re using our influence to
support global efforts to tackle modern
slavery and we’re working hard to negate
any related risks in our supply chain.

As a global footwear, sports and fashion company, we
depend on the people who work for us – and we’re
committed to respecting their rights. We have a strong
history in trading ethically and we are a founding
member of the Ethical Trading Initiative.
We publish a list of tier one factories on our website,
and in 2018 we continued to monitor factory working
conditions in line with Our Standards. We partner with
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and suppliers
to build their capacity to implement our ethical trade
requirements. We’ve strengthened our approach by
communicating our new Corporate Responsibility
Charter to all our suppliers, including our policies
to protect the most vulnerable in our supply chain.
We’ve continued to train hundreds of people across the
business, so they can spot the first signs of modern
slavery, however subtle. Assessing risks and training
employees at our UK distribution centres was
a particular focus this year.

Partnering with local experts, NGOs, other brands and
buyers remains an important part of our approach
in addressing the complex issue of modern slavery.
In 2018, we worked closely with Homeworkers
Worldwide and Cividep to raise pay rates for
homeworkers involved in making footwear for one
of our suppliers in India. And, together with the Issara
Institute, we’ve used our influence to establish ethical
recruitment practices for migrant workers at a factory
in Thailand.
We signed up to ACT’s new global purchasing practices
commitments this year, which we’ll implement over
the next five years. In 2019, we’ll review our modern
slavery strategy, continue to map and address risks
in our supply chain, use training to raise awareness
across our business and continue our programmes with
local NGO partners in India and Thailand.
I look forward to providing an updated report on our
progress next year.

Status

Progress

Setting
standards

Roll out vulnerable worker policies to all suppliers, as part
of reformatted supplier communications.

Achieved

All suppliers received our new Corporate Responsibility Charter that brings together all our requirements.

Translate migrant worker policies into Thai,
Burmese and Khmer.

Achieved

Migrant worker policies are now available in Thai and Burmese for factory management and recruitment agents
as these are the main languages spoken by those using the migrant worker policies.

Review and update Our Standards.

Ongoing

We’re committed to reviewing Our Standards every year.

Translate Our Standards into Burmese.

Ongoing

We’ll translate Our Standards once they’ve been updated.

Provide face-to-face training for 320 more employees in relevant
roles on ways to identify modern slavery risks.

Ongoing

We trained 172 people in factory facing and warehouse roles, and 20 in distribution centres. We’ll continue
to train people in high risk roles.

Reach all employees with online training on modern slavery.

Ongoing

Online training has been rolled out to all employees and more than 680 have completed it. In the coming years
we’ll focus on increasing the number of employees completing the training.

Continue to map and risk assess
our second tier suppliers.

Ongoing

Reaching further tiers of our supply chain is a complex task and we’re continuing to map, and risk assess
second tier suppliers. Having established our list of preferred second tier suppliers in 2018, we are now
working on mapping locally-sourced materials and component suppliers that we presently do not have
a relationship with.

Develop and embed a system for monitoring
homeworking standards.

Ongoing

We established improved wages for homeworkers of one supplier in India and we’re continuing to collaborate
with Homeworkers Worldwide to evaluate and embed the project outcomes.

Continue social audits of suppliers to investigate risks and
remedy any issues discovered.

Achieved

93 social audits of suppliers were completed in 2018, of which 12 were part of the Better Work programme.
We also revised our audit process to complete more semi-announced audits.

Strengthen our whistleblowing and grievance reporting systems
for workers at suppliers’ factories.

Partly
Achieved

Through our partnership with NGOs such as the Issara Institute, we’re building factories’ capacity and
understanding of grievance mechanisms. We also piloted an app to help buying teams spot issues when they
visit factories.

Definitions
Stock

Direct

This is the supply chain that creates
our consumer products, the branded
stock we sell to customers. Our tier 1
suppliers cut, sew and assemble our
finished products. A supplier may own
and manage multiple factories.

This means we order products directly
from the assembly factory or from the
supplier that owns the factory.

Non-stock
Our non-stock supply chain is
everything else we purchase to support
our business, whether that be services,
such as cleaning, or consumables, such
as stationery.

Indirect
This means we work through agents
and/or suppliers that don’t own the
factories, who may help with a range
of things, such as quality control,
product development, translations or
factory sourcing. We still ultimately
own the factory relationship and we
don’t delegate any of our corporate
responsibility to the agent.

Who we are and how we work

Mapping our
supply chain
Being transparent about who we
source from helps us work in a more,
constructive, open and collaborative
way with our suppliers, customers,
other brands, NGOs and civil society.
This means:
• Factories are more accountable for their standards
• W
 e can collaborate with brands that source from
the same factories as us
• P
 eople can alert us if they’ve found an issue at one
of the factories we source from
We publish a list of our first tier suppliers on our
website. In 2018, we continued to map our second
tier suppliers of materials and components to help us
choose the most sustainable options and understand
where we might be able to responsibly consolidate
our suppliers.

Tackling
modern
slavery

Tackling modern slavery

What is modern
slavery?
Modern slavery is a
prevalent issue within
modern supply chains.
It’s not confined to
developing countries
or pages of history.
It’s happening now and
it’s happening globally.
The Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) uses
the term ‘modern slavery’ to describe:

Human trafficking
A process of bringing a person into a situation
of exploitation through a series of actions,
including deceptive recruitment and coercion.

Forced labour
Any work or services which people are not
doing voluntarily, and which are exacted under
a threat of some form of punishment.

Bonded labour

It can also include victims of forced
marriage, domestic servitude and
sexual exploitation. The term ‘modern’
is used to distinguish this complex
phenomenon from historical slavery
associated with the legal possession
of one person by another.
Estimates on the scale of the issue
vary widely because cases are difficult
to detect. It’s been reported that
approximately 40 million men, women
and children around the world are
in some form of slavery.

Work demanded as a means of repayment
of a debt or a loan.

Slavery
A situation where a person exercises
(perceived) power of ownership over
another person.
12

Tackling modern slavery

Challenges
for our sector
No industry is
immune to modern
slavery. Supply
chains in the apparel
and footwear industry
are complex, making
it hard to control
every stage in
production. There are
over 123,300 people
working at our first
tier suppliers alone.

Migrant workers
Migrant workers are common in
global supply chains, particularly in
sectors relying on low skilled labour.
Unfortunately, migrant workers tend to
be vulnerable to exploitation, human
trafficking and very low wages. They
can be forced to work, paid little or
nothing, have identity documents
withheld and made to pay for their
own recruitment.

Working with agents
Sometimes agents are used to
find suppliers or consolidate
relationships with a manufacturer.
Using an agent can make it harder
to maintain transparency of factory
manufacturing sites.

13

Tackling modern slavery

Challenges
for our sector
Child labour and young workers

The licensed business model

The International Labour Organisation (ILO)
estimates there are at least around 152 million
victims of child labour globally, half of which are
children aged 5-11 years1. Children are also
vulnerable to hazardous work that could harm
their heath or development.

This model is common with global brands
and can mean that there is no commercial
relationship with partner factories, making it
difficult to enforce standards at a factory level.

Casual and homeworkers

We’re not in the business of fast fashion, but
we do work to four annual peaks in demand.
Excessive demands from companies can
increase the risk of modern slavery if suppliers
enforce excessive working hours, draft in
temporary labour or subcontract the work to
meet a client’s deadline.

Hand stitching of products such as footwear
often happens in people’s homes situated in
low income, rural areas. This can make human
rights issues difficult to manage because the
supply chain is informal and dispersed. There
is a lack of visibility of homeworking supply
chains, and legislation protecting the human
rights and employment status of homeworkers
and casual workers is often weaker.

http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/child-labour/lang--en/index.htm 1

Demand cycles

These are shared challenges, requiring
collective action to make progress. Find out
what we’re doing to tackle these issues on
page 17.

Tackling modern slavery

Our
approach
For Pentland Brands, modern
slavery is an unacceptable
issue. We state clearly in Our
Standards that work should
be freely chosen and we set
out our position on the most
vulnerable workers in our
policies on child labour and
young workers, migrant workers
and homeworking.
We know that human trafficking and modern
slavery can be difficult to detect. But we are
committed to conducting due diligence on this
issue and understanding, investigating and
resolving any cases that our risk assessments
and ongoing monitoring might uncover.

A UN priority
At Pentland Brands we’ve prioritised eight
of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals,
including goals 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13.

Goal 8: Decent Work
and Economic Growth
Target 8.7: Take immediate and effective
measures to eradicate forced labour, end
modern slavery and human trafficking and
secure the prohibition and elimination of
the worst forms of child labour, including
recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by
2025 end child labour in all its forms.

“As a business, ‘in good conscience’
is one of our guiding principles that
influences the way we operate. We’re
moving from policy into action with the
support of local experts and tools giving
workers in our supply chain a voice.
Our goal is to support our partners and
our industry in protecting human rights
and providing people with the basic
right to decent work.”
Matt Rock
President - Asia Pacific
Pentland Brands

Our focus on modern slavery also supports
Goal 10, which aims to reduce inequality.

What we’re doing

Setting
standards
Our Standards guides
the way we work and set
out what we expect from
our employees, partners
and suppliers.
It includes guidance
on how to do business
ethically, with integrity
and with respect for
people, and is available
in 13 languages.
See page 22 for details on how
we audit factories in line with
these standards.

Our standards and policies
Our Licensee Sourcing Manual makes it
clear that we expect licensees to follow
the same high ethical standards and tell us
which factories they source from.
We have detailed policies in place to
protect three types of vulnerable workers
in our supply chain.
These are available on our website:

	Child labour and
young worker policy
	Migrant worker policy
	Homeworking policy

Feedback from the ETI and Anti-Slavery
International, alongside several experts and
regional NGOs, informed the policies, which
give our suppliers and partners detailed
guidance on implementing Our Standards.
In 2018, we introduced our Corporate
Responsibility Charter for suppliers. It outlines
our ethics and governance requirements and
how we expect our suppliers to protect people
and the environment. We contacted every
supplier and asked them to commit to the
Charter in 2018.
We’re also supporting our own people to make
sure they’re confident in partnering with the
right suppliers. This year, we developed a
guide to ethical sourcing to support our buying
teams in selecting new suppliers and ensuring
existing suppliers comply with our standards.

17

What we’re doing

Setting
standards
Purchasing practices
We want to support suppliers in tacking
modern slavery risks by making sure
we don’t inadvertently encourage
practices such as unauthorised
subcontracting, late wage payments
or overly long working hours.
We strive to take a responsible
approach to purchasing, including
planning, sourcing and buying. We
pay suppliers quickly to support
their cashflow – in 2018, 83% of our
suppliers were paid within 30 days of
receipt of shipping documents.
Pentland Brands is a founding
member of the ACT Foundation,
a partnership of brands and the global
union IndustriALL, that is committed
to improving wages in the apparel and
footwear industry.

We’ve adopted ACT’s global purchasing
practices commitments, which were
launched in 2018 to create continuous
wage growth and better conditions
for workers. We helped develop the
commitments as a member of the
Foundation’s Purchasing Practices
Working Group. We’ll implement the
changes needed to fully meet them by
the end of 2023, the timeline agreed by
all ACT members (see box).
We also supported ACT’s work to
establish country-specific sourcing
commitments in 2018 for countries that
are the first to engage in negotiating
a collective bargaining agreement at
industry level. We’ll use our buying
power as a brand to preferentially
source from these countries.

ACT Global Purchasing
Practices Commitments
As a founding member of the ACT Foundation,
we’ve committed that by 2023 we will:
1. E
 nsure purchasing prices include wages as
itemised costs
2. Establish fair terms of payments
3. Strive for better planning and forecasting
4. U
 ndertake training on responsible sourcing
and buying
5. Practice responsible exit strategies.

18

What we’re doing

Training our people
and partners
We’re training hundreds
of employees across our
business to spot indicators
of modern slavery,
wherever they work. More
than 680 of our people
have completed the online
training, including our
Executive Team.

Everyone in factory facing
and warehouse roles owns
a toolkit to help them identify
potential indicators of modern
slavery during factory visits
or in our warehouses. In 2018,
we trained 172 people in
these roles.
We have also introduced
training to help people working
in our UK distribution centres
spot signs of modern slavery,
where the risks could be higher
than in our UK office buildings.
We trained 20 managers and
supervisors at three distribution
centres in 2018.

The ‘ABC’ of modern slavery
Modern slavery can be hard to spot.
The signs can be subtle, such as someone
seeming anxious or withdrawn, wearing
clothes unsuitable for their job, or having few
personal possessions.
Our modern slavery toolkit is designed to
help our staff recognise and report potential
slavery indicators. The ABC toolkit should be
used when visiting: Suppliers, Subcontractors,
Warehouses, Product re-processors, Service
providers and reminds them to look out for risks
in three areas: Appearance, Behaviour
and Conditions.
We train our factory-facing, distribution centre
and warehouse teams to use the toolkit through
a series of scenarios designed to help them
spot indicators in real situations. In the event
that indicators are spotted, we ensure they
understand how to report their observations
back to the corporate responsibility team.
19

What we’re doing

Understanding
our risks
Modern slavery can
happen anywhere in
the world. However, the
risk is greater in some
countries than others.
Understanding where the
risks lie in our supply chain
is an important step in
our journey to eradicate
modern slavery. That’s
exactly what our first tier
supplier risk assessment
tool is for.

Assessing country
and factory level risks
Developed with Lancaster University,
the tool helps us to build a modern
slavery risk profile for the regions we
source from. Together with various data
sources, it feeds into country level risk
profiles, which evaluate:
• T
 he prevalence of forced labour
in the country
• T
 he strength of government
action to combat it
• T
 he vulnerability of the country
to modern slavery

We also use our social audits and
a detailed supplier questionnaire
to understand risk at a factory level.
In 2018, we reviewed and expanded
the questions to understand our
suppliers’ approach on additional types
of labour relations issues, including
freedom of association and gender
equality. We will combine the risk
profile of the region with new factory
level data on areas such as the
factory’s proximity to borders, worker
demographics, and the presence of
policies and management systems.

What we’re doing

Identifying issues
and taking action
Working with factories
We conduct social audits for all our first
tier assembly factories on a regular
basis to ensure compliance with Our
Standards. The audits are performed by
a combination of external consultants,
our corporate responsibility team
and other organisations, such as
Better Work. All external auditors are
independently certified social auditors.
If an issue is identified, our experienced
corporate responsibility team works
with factories to analyse the root cause,
remedy the issue and make lasting
improvements to working conditions
in line with Our Standards.

Factory review process
We try to avoid terminating
relationships with factories
because this response lacks
benefit for the workforce.
However, we will exit a
relationship if a factory
refuses to improve. In these
cases, we make sure we
exit factory relationships
responsibly, in a way that
minimises any negative impact
on the workforce.

They must be approved
before our brands can place
any orders with them

Factory audits by country

Supplier audits in 2018
In 2018, we conducted 104 audits
(compared with 96 in 2017). Sixteen
of these were part of the Better Work
programme. The increased number of
audits was a result of the addition of new
factories supplying Endura and Karen
Millen which joined Pentland Brands
in 2018 and the expansion of our
Ellesse Direct range. We also trialled
semi-announced audits where we audit
a supplier within a two-week timeframe,
without providing an exact date of our visit.
During the social audits we conducted in
2018, most instances of non-compliance
were minor, but 31% of instances were
classed as critical (up from 20% in 2017).
The increase in critical issues is partly due
to the number of new factories supplying
our brands this year. The most common
critical issues related to inconsistencies

found in workers’ wage records,
inadequate holidays provided to workers,
lack of social insurance provision, general
health and safety issues, and excessive
working hours.
We did not find any zero tolerance
instances of employment not being freely
chosen. However, we identified nine zero
tolerance issues related to payment of
living wages and excessive working hours
that could be indicators of modern slavery.
Two of these instances have been resolved
and we’re working closely with suppliers
to resolve the remaining issues by training
supervisors, helping them improve their
record-keeping systems and building their
capacity to comply with our standards.

What we’re doing

Identifying issues
and taking action
Our modern slavery
investigation process
Modern slavery can be hard to spot,
and can include concealed and criminal
activities. This complexity means social
audit processes – including our own –
aren’t always sufficient to identify all cases
of modern slavery.
Our in-depth modern slavery investigation
process is designed to investigate the
whole employee experience – from
recruitment to leaving the company – to
identify potential modern slavery risks. We
developed it in partnership with Verité; an
expert in supply chain, labour and human
rights issues.

We used this process to assess a factory
in Thailand in November 2016, where
we found indicators of modern slavery,
particularly related to migrant worker
recruitment and employment. We worked
closely with the factory’s management
to resolve these issues, which we have
reported on in detail in our previous
Modern Slavery Reports.
In 2018, we continued to work with a
locally-based international NGO, Issara
Institute, to begin embedding our modern
slavery approach and improve grievance
mechanisms at a second factory in
Thailand. This work is ongoing, and we’ll
report on progress in future years. We’re
also working with Issara Institute to
improve ethical recruitment practices in
Thailand (see page 28).
25

What we’re doing

Identifying issues
and taking action
Giving workers a voice
We want everyone in our supply chain
to be treated with dignity and respect
and feel they can speak up. We’re
enabling workers to find their voice
by using Issara Institute’s Inclusive
Labour Monitoring system at factories
in Thailand and Myanmar which allows
employees to raise concerns through
a multilingual hotline and smartphone
app. We’re also informing homeworkers
of their rights to bargain collectively to
negotiate better working conditions with
employers and agents.

Helping buyers
spot modern slavery
It’s not only trained specialists or auditors
that can spot the signs of modern slavery
– anyone that visits factories can.
In 2018, we partnered with the
consultancy Carnstone, and other ETI
members to pilot an app especially for
buyers. Commercial teams regularly
visit factories to discuss orders and
production with suppliers.
The Everyone’s Business app gives
buyers modern slavery guidance at their
fingertips. They can check the top risks
in the country they’re visiting, flag any
issues they spot on the factory floor
and share insights with the corporate
responsibility team.

Putting policy into practice

Embedding ethical recruitment
practices in Thailand
It’s common for migrant
workers to be recruited for
low skilled work in Thailand,
often from neighbouring
countries such as Cambodia
and Myanmar.
Labour migration can be
a successful and positive
experience for workers, but
it can also lead to potential
risks of modern slavery
through recruitment and
employment practices.

In 2018, we continued to embed a best
practice approach to migrant worker
rights and recruitment in the factories we
source from in Thailand. Our vulnerable
worker policies make our expectations
clear to suppliers and business partners
and provide guidance on managing
migrant workers. We’re also partnering
with Bangkok-based international NGO,
Issara Institute, to put ethical recruitment
practices in place.
Migrant workers often have little choice in
paying middlemen brokers and recruitment
agency fees to secure a job. There’s also
a risk they’ll be indebted to new employers,
and consequently have their freedom
of movement restricted and their wages
underpaid to cover hidden costs.

“There are not many factories recruiting
workers with zero fees. It would be
good if all the factories could practice
zero fees policies so workers can go
without being in debt and can support

Embedding ethical recruitment
practices in Thailand
Zero-fee recruitment

Connected workers

Together with Issara, we’ve eliminated
recruitment fees at one of our Thai
suppliers. The factory now deals with a
recruitment agency in Myanmar directly,
instead of using intermediate Thai
agencies. Procedures are also more
clearly communicated to jobseekers.
The factory renegotiated their contract
with the agent to cover the costs.

Issara’s Golden Dreams smartphone app
provides further support for current and
prospective Burmese-speaking migrants.
It’s a platform for workers to learn and
exchange information, reviews, ratings,
comments, and advice about employers,
recruiters and service providers in both
home and destination countries. Issara
works closely with recruitment agencies in
source countries to develop more ethical
practices along with suppliers in the
destination countries.

This zero-fee recruitment approach
means intermediary agents can’t pass
on informal fees that end up being paid
by workers. We’ve visited Myanmar
to meet with recruiters directly and
translated the factory worker manual,
including the zero-fees policy, into
Burmese. More than 42 workers
have been compensated more than
480,300 Thai Baht (£11,000 GBP) for
recruitment costs since January 2018.

Worker voice and empowerment is
integrated throughout jobseekers’ and
migrant workers’ journey, helping them
to know their rights, make more informed
decisions and avoid exploitative fees, while
improving transparency and providing
insights on actual working conditions.

“Foreign migrant workers comprise a
significant percentage of our work force
and it is important to us that they are
not having to pay high fees and find
jobs through informal brokers. We are
implementing a zero recruitment fees
to workers approach, which is also a
requirement of our customer, Pentland
Brands. It can be difficult to have
visibility of the recruitment process
in Myanmar but working directly with
the Myanmar recruitment agency and
having our workers communicate job
opportunities to their friends and family,
has been an effective way to remove
risk and fees.”

Assessing risk at our
UK distribution centres
Many of our products pass
through our UK distribution
centres on their journey
to reach our customers.
Sometimes during high
season, we take on extra
staff through agencies.
Using a temporary workforce
can be linked to increased
risks of modern slavery.
In 2018, we asked a leading international
slavery NGO, Hope for Justice, to review
our approach. Hope for Justice conducted
an in-depth review of our exposure to
modern slavery risks at our national
distribution centre in the UK.

They evaluated our modern slavery policies,
due diligence processes, training and
procedures we have in place to reduce modern
slavery risks. They found that we have many
important policies and procedures in place,
including paying all workers living wages.
There’s also room for improvement and we’re
taking on board their recommendations at
all our UK distribution centres. This includes
clearly referencing modern slavery in our
recruitment policy and code of conduct
and doing more to promote the confidential
whistleblowing policy.
We’re also raising awareness of modern
slavery across our workforce and training
recruitment agents on the issue. We trained
20 managers and supervisors at three UK
distribution centres in 2018.

“Ending modern slavery is a huge challenge,
but one we tackle with hope. We were pleased
to find Pentland Brands has hope too – we
reviewed their modern slavery policies and
approach at their national distribution centre,
and while we made minor recommendations on
how to improve their procedures even further,
overall we were impressed. We welcome
their commitment to training staff and raising
awareness of this issue and look forward to
continuing to work with Pentland Brands, to
ensure their operations and supply chains are
protected from modern slavery.”

Supporting vulnerable
homeworkers in India
The stitching of certain
parts of our footwear is
a skill that is completed
by hand. There are many
homeworkers involved in
hand-stitching, and we aim
to support them as a vital
part of our supply chain.

Homeworkers are often women relying
on paid work that’s flexible and fits
in with their family and domestic
duties. We recognise there are risks
to homeworking. It’s typically informal,
low-paid and insecure work, organised
through a network of agents. This
gives homeworkers little visibility in
supply chains or control over their
employment conditions.
The easiest way to eliminate these
risks in our supply chain would be for
us to ban homeworking. However, this
approach would do little to benefit
homeworkers. Since 2016, we’ve
worked with Homeworkers Worldwide
and Cividep on a pilot programme to
map homeworkers for one supplier in
our leather shoe supply chain.

Since the programme began, our
NGO partners have mapped the
network of agents and homeworkers
in the supply chain of one of our
suppliers. They interviewed more
than 200 homeworkers and 11 agents
distributing work to them. This helped
us create a map of prices paid
along the value chain and identify
opportunities to improve livelihoods for
homeworkers. The homeworkers are
paid a ‘piece rate’ – a fixed amount
for every piece they stitch. Agents
charge commission for tracking orders
and quality control, which reduces the
workers’ pay.

Supporting vulnerable
homeworkers in India
Since September 2018,
these homeworkers have
been paid at a higher piece
rate, to meet minimum
standards. We’ve also
supported the supplier to
register homeworkers and
introduce a simple paperbased system to track
orders and payments made.

Our detailed policy for homeworking
gives all our suppliers clearer guidance
to protect homeworkers.
We’re continuing to work with NGOs,
suppliers and agents to establish
grievance and collective bargaining
mechanisms, to improve recordkeeping, and extend access to social
protection and healthcare. We’re
also sharing what we’ve learned and
encouraging other apparel brands to
change their approach to create
a greater impact for homeworkers
across India.

“Homeworkers Worldwide has been
delighted to work with Pentland Brands
on this project and appreciates their
commitment to improving the pay and
conditions of the homeworkers in their
Kickers supply chain.
We look forward to working with
them in 2019, to verify the important
achievements thus far, and to develop
and implement a model for the good
employment of homeworkers, which we
will then be promoting to other brands
and their suppliers in the sector.”
