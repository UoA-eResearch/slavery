We seek to work with suppliers who share our
commitment to responsible business practices. The
|.Crew Code of Vendor Conduct Is the basis for the
Responsible Sourcing program at |.Crew and sets
forth the guiding principles that are expected of our
suppliers. Our code prohibits the
use of forced labor of any kind, including slavery and
human trafficking.

All |.Crew associates are required to certify
acceptance of our Code of Ethics and Business
Practices. Among other expectations, associates are
expected to act professionally and ethically and
comply with all applicable laws where we do
business. Any failure to comply with the Code of
Ethics and Business Practices could lead to
corrective action, up to and including termination.
Our Code of Ethics and Business Practices is

Qur vendors are contractually required to comply

with our Responsible Sourcing Supplier Guidelines,

expectations to the key mills that supply fabric for

The j.Crew Production department is responsible for
managing the relationship with our suppliers.
Production and Responsible Sourcing work hand in
hand to monitor supplier conditions and achieve
program goals. In 2011, we required Production
associates to participate in the University of
Delawarelj+2s Risks of Human Trafficking and
Slavery Short Course webinar, designed specifically
to provide relevant information to sourcing
professionals. In addition, we regularly conduct
training seminars for our Production team on our
Responsible Sourcing requirements and how to
consistently manage suppliers to achieve our
Responsible Sourcing goals.

In addition to internal trainings, we regularly conduct
Responsible Sourcing training seminars for suppliers.
These seminars focus on our Code of Vendor
Conduct program requirements and other relevant
topics, including working hours and overtime, health
and safety and management systems.
