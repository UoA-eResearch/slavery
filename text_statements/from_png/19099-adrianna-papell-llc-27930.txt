Disclosure under the California Transparency in Supply Chains
Act and UK Modern Slavery Act

This Statement relates to our fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 ("Fiscal 2016"). This Statement describes the activities of
Adrianna Papell LLC and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, the ?Company, ?we or Itis the
Company's policy to comply with all applicable laws relating to its supply chains and the Company has procedures in place to
evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery consistent with the California Transparency Act and the Modern
Slavery Act of 2015. As part of periodic and routine audits of our third-party manufacturing contractors, suppliers and vendors
(Suppliers) conducted by our agents, we verify compliance with Company standards against human trafficking and slavery in
its supply chains as set forth in the Company's Global Social Compliance Guide (?Compliance Guide") and Code of Conduct.
Adrianna Papell has confirmed with its Suppliers that materials incorporated into our products comply with applicable laws
against slavery and human trafficking in the countries in which they are doing business. Our employees and business partners
are aware of the appropriate action to take in the event that a supplier does not meet Company standards regarding slavery and
trafficking, and ongoing educational efforts are conducted for Company employees and management who have direct

responsibility for supply chain management.

Our Business.

The Adrianna Papell Group, is a leading women?s apparel company, founded in New York in 1979 and celebrates over 3/7 years
of dressing women for all occasions. The Company has been focused on a single mission: ?to make every woman feel beautiful?.
With an artisanal attention to detail, the Adrianna Papell collections are best known for an elegance and flair that empowers
women of all ages and silhouettes to feel their very best. The key to our success is strategically positioning ourselves as a brand
that offers modern fashion at an affordable prices. The Adrianna Papell brand has a substantial market share in the dress
business and 1s distributed to all leading retailers in the United States and has expanded its business across 2/ countries,

including the UE, through various channels and free standing stores globally.

Our Products.

Our products are manufactured to our specifications. We contract for the purchase of finished goods principally with
independent third-party manufacturing contractors, whereby the manutacturing contractor is generally responsible for the entire
manufacturing process. Most of our products are produced by third-party factories in Asia. We have zero tolerance to slavery
and human trafficking. We expect all those in our supply chain and Suppliers and agents to comply with our values and our Code
of Conduct.

Risks of Slavery and Human Trafficking in Supply Chain.

Due to the nature of our workforce and the locations of most of our employees, we believe that the risks of slavery and human
trafficking in our own business are remote. While there are risks inherent with third-party manufacturing, we have established
the Compliance Guide, Code of Conduct and other procedures to mitigate the risks of slavery and human trafficking in our supply
chains for our products. Our approach is to focus on our direct Suppliers, since this is the level of the supply chain where we

believe that we have the most influence and can therefore be the most effective.

Commitment to Ethics; Code of Conduct

We are committed to principles of ethical business practice and recognition of the dignity of others, including responsible labor
practices. Our Compliance Guide and Code of Conduct are applicable to all of the Company's Suppliers ?including our third-
party manufacturers, suppliers and vendors). The Code of Conduct expressly prohibits, among other things, the use of prison or
forced labor or the acquisition of any materials used in any stage of the manufacturing of our products from a third-party that
utilizes prison or forced labor. In addition, the Code of Conduct provides that our Suppliers must comply with all laws regulating
local wages, work hours and benefits. We communicate the Compliance Guide and Code of Conduct initially as part of our
Supplier onboarding process and, thereatter, periodically from time to time, including when there are updates. All of our
Suppliers are required to certify compliance with the Code of Conduct. In the event of a violation of the Code of Conduct, we
reserve the right to either terminate our relationship with the Supplier or to work with the supplier to implement corrective action

to remedy the non-conformance.

Audits and Reviews.

Allnew Suppliers are approved after they pass our compliance and production requirements. We require engagement with one

of our approved third party independent social compliance auditing agencies within one (1) year of initial orders. The production,

buying and design team visit Suppliers on a regular basis to continue to build a strong working partnership. In most instances,
where a deficiency is identified, corrective action is required on a specified timeline, followed by validation by the Company or its
auditor that such deficiency has been remedied, including, if necessary through a re-audit of the manufacturer. In the case of a
serious violation of the Code of Conduct, termination of the Company's relationship with the manufacturer may occur,

particularly where corrective action is either not possible or determined to be an insufficient remedy.

Internal Accountability and Training.

All production employees are required to undergo compliance and ethics training, including with respect to the Code of Conduct

and the Compliance Guide.

This statement is made pursuant to section of the Modern Slavery Act 20175 and constitutes our group's slavery and

human trafficking statement for the current financial year.
