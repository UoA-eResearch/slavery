consumers about the efforts of
manufacturers and retailers to
eliminate the risk of modern day
slavery, forced laber, human
trafficking and similar human rights
violations ("slavery and human
trafficking") from their supply
chain. Accordingly, below are some
examples of how we are working to
eliminate that risk from our supply
chain.

RISK ASSESSMENT. The Company
internally assesses the risk of slavery
and human trafficking with respect to
the supply chain for all of its
products. To judge which of its
sourcing countries presents the highest
risk levels, the Company utilizes
several resources, including the U.S.
State Department's annual Trafficking
in Persons Report's country rankings,
the United Nations Office on Drugs
and Crime?s Global Report on
Trafficking in Persons, the Director-
General of the International Labour
Organization?s reports on forced
labor, and the U.S. Department of
Labor?s List of Goods Produced by
Child Labor or Forced Labor. The
Company continuously assesses its risk
as these resources are updated and as
new, credible resources become

available.

2. AUDITS. The Company conducts

audits of its direct suppliers to evaluate
compliance with the Company's
Standards for Contractors and
Suppliers, which include standards for
slavery and human trafficking in the
supply chain.do determine factory
selection and timing for audits we look
at several criteria, including factory
location [country], size, workforce
composition and past compliance
performance, if available, to determine
facility risk and audit priority.In
addition to our internal staff, we retain
a number of recognized, unaffiliated
third party workplace compliance
audit firms to conduct both announced
and unannounced factory audits on
our behalf.

The Company utilizes a scorecard
system fo assign risk levels to suppliers
objectively based on audit results. The
scorecard concept is a data-driven
process, with the underlying premises
that not all violations should be treated
equally and that some findings are
more serious and not as easily
corrected as others. By comparing
audit results, the scorecard system
allows fhe Company to evaluate and
determine where monitoring is needed
most. Over time, audit scores reflect
the compliance status of a factory,
making it a useful tool for internal
production divisions to benchmark their
factories, vendors and agents when
making sourcing decisions. The
Company also supports ongoing
supplier improvements through training

and technical assistance.

J. SUPPLIER CERTIFICATION. The

Company requires that all of its
suppliers comply with applicable laws
within their country of business
regarding slavery and human
trafficking. Since 1996, the
Company has required all of its
contractors and suppliers to adhere to
its Standards for Contractors and
Suppliers, which, among other things,
prohibits child labor and any form of
forced, compulsory, honded,
indentured or prison labor and
requires compliance with applicable
laws and regulations regarding health
and safety in working conditions. In
addition, as part of the Company's
purchase order and commercial
invoice processes, factories are
required to certify compliance with the
Company's Standards concerning
elimination of the risk of slavery and
human trafficking practices in their

supply chains.

4. ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARDS
AND PROCEDURES. All Company

employees and agents with
production, sourcing or quality control
responsibilities, as well as internal
buying offices and trading companies
doing business with the Company, are
provided with copies of the Company's
compliance program policies and
procedures related to the enforcement
of its Standards for Contractors and
Suppliers. These policies and
procedures, which are outlined in our
Corporate Compliance Operations
Manual, include issuance of zero
tolerance notifications for violations of
the Company's prohibition on use of
child or forced labor and
implementation of corrective action
plans. In the case of non-compliance,
the Company examines the specific
sitvation and develops an appropriate

strategy for resolution.

5. TRAINING. The Company conducts
internal training of its managers and
employees with direct responsibility for
supply chain management that
specifically raises awareness of
slavery and human trafficking and
focuses on mitigating the risks within
our supply chain. In addition, the
Companys internal corporate
compliance employees, as well as
third party monitors contracted to audit
facilities in the Company's supply
chain, have participated in training
jointly developed and delivered by the
United Nations Global Initiative to
Fight Human Trafficking 
and the International Labor
Organization That training
helps internal and external monitors to
thoroughly monitor the risk of forced
labor in the Company's supply chain
and to develop and deliver training
programs for agents, vendors and
other supply chain partners on the
issue, including how fo identify and
mitigate forced labor and trafficking
risks in their recruitment processes.

The Company also conducts training
programs targeted to suppliers on
fopics that support awareness of the
Company's Standards for Contractors
and Suppliers to ensure the
appropriate participants in supply
chain management are
knowledgeable concerning the
Company's requirements for suppliers.
The Company encourages its agents,
vendors and suppliers to participate in
seminars and training programs on
social compliance issues (including the
issues of slavery and human
trafficking) to further raise awareness
of the issues and mitigate the risks

within the Company's supply chain.
